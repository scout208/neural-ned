{"content": "\nWhile the Bible clearly teaches that God elects people to salvation, there are disagreements as to the basis of that election. Conditional election is the belief that God elects people for salvation based on His foreknowledge of who will put their faith in Christ. Conditional election says that an all-knowing God looks to the future and decides to elect people based on a future decision they will make to come to faith in Christ. It is considered \u201cconditional\u201d election because it is based on the condition of man doing something of his own free will. According to conditional election, those who God knows will come to faith in Christ are elected by God, and those who God knows will not accept Christ are not elected. Conditional election is one of the Articles of Remonstrance that define Arminian theology, and it is a core part of that worldview and theological system. As such, it stands in direct contrast to the belief held by those who hold to Reformed theology, which believes that the Bible teaches unconditional election, the view that God elects people based on His sovereign will and not on any future action of the person being elected. Those who believe in conditional election will often cite verses like 1 Peter 1:1\u20132, where Peter is writing \u201cto those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.\u201d The key phrase here is elect . . . according to the foreknowledge of God. Or another verse with similar implications is Romans 8:29\u201330: \u201cFor those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined, he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\u201d Yet there really is no debate or disagreement in the fact that God, because He is all-knowing, knows beforehand who will be saved and who will not. The debate between conditional and unconditional election is about whether these verses teach that man\u2019s \u201cfree will choice\u201d is the cause of God\u2019s election or an acknowledgement that God has the foreknowledge of who will be saved and who will not. If these were the only verses in Scripture that dealt with election, the issue as to whether the Bible teaches conditional election would be up for debate, but they are not. There are other very clear passages that tell us on what basis God elects people for salvation. The first verse that helps us understand whether conditional election is what the Bible really teaches is Ephesians 1:4\u20135: \u201cHe chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of His will.\u201d Clearly, we see that God predestines or elects individuals \u201caccording to the purpose of His will.\u201d When we consider the idea of adoption and the fact that it is God who chooses us for adoption and that it is done before the foundation of the world, it seems to be clear that the basis of God\u2019s election and predestination is not a choice we would make in the future but solely His sovereign will, which He exercises \u201cin love.\u201d Another verse that strongly supports unconditional election is Romans 9:11, where God describes \u201cthe children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but of Him who calls.\u201d While some want to dismiss Romans 9:11 as applying to corporate election and not individual election, we simply cannot dismiss this section of Scripture that clearly teaches that election is NOT conditioned on anything man has done or will do but is solely based on the divine will of a sovereign God. Another verse that teaches unconditional election is John 15:16, \u201cYou did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide.\u201d Further, in John 10:26\u201327 Jesus says, \u201cBut you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. My sheep hear My voice and I know them, and they follow me.\u201d Conditional election says that people who believe are chosen as His sheep because they believe, but the Bible actually says just the opposite. The reason they believe is that they are His sheep. Election is not conditional upon man\u2019s acceptance of Christ as Lord and Savior but is instead the cause of his acceptance. Conditional election is the view that man\u2019s \u201cfree will\u201d decision to accept Christ as Savior is the basis for his/her election. Therefore, in a very real sense, man\u2019s decision is the cause of salvation. This view of election is in large part necessary because of the Arminian worldview where man chooses God, instead of God choosing man. Boiled down to its simplest form, Arminian theology is that, ultimately, man\u2019s salvation depends on his \u201cfree will decision\u201d alone and not God\u2019s will. Conditional election leads to the conclusion that God\u2019s actions in election are dependent upon man\u2019s free will choices. This view of election and salvation makes God subject to the whims of men and their decisions, and man\u2019s will becomes essentially the cause and effect of salvation. On the other hand, in unconditional election it is God\u2019s sovereign will that determines who is elected and who is not. Therefore, it is God\u2019s will and God\u2019s grace that are completely responsible for man\u2019s salvation. All those whom God elects to salvation will come to saving faith in Christ, and those whom He does not elect will not (John 6:37). In this scenario, it is God who gets the glory for His grace and mercy in offering salvation to those who do not love Him and who can\u2019t come to Him on their own (Ephesians 2:1\u20135). These two views on election are not compatible at all. One is true, and the other is false. One makes God\u2019s election and ultimately man\u2019s salvation dependent upon man, ultimately giving man the credit and glory, while the other recognizes that election and salvation depend on God\u2019s sovereign will. One worldview has man being the master of his destiny and, in essence, in control of his salvation, while the other has God rescuing lost, hopeless sinners not because they deserve it but because He wills it. One view exalts man, and the other exalts God. One is a testimony to man\u2019s goodness and ability, and the other is a testimony to God\u2019s amazing grace.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 6451, "end": 6453, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 6364, "end": 6366, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 6233, "end": 6235, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 6202, "end": 6210, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["attributes_of_god"], "points": [{"start": 6097, "end": 6105, "text": "sovereign"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 6091, "end": 6093, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 6071, "end": 6079, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5952, "end": 5960, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5916, "end": 5918, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5717, "end": 5725, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5685, "end": 5687, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5658, "end": 5660, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 5571, "end": 5576, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5532, "end": 5540, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5518, "end": 5520, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5492, "end": 5500, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5438, "end": 5440, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5423, "end": 5425, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["attributes_of_god"], "points": [{"start": 5344, "end": 5352, "text": "sovereign"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5338, "end": 5340, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 5311, "end": 5330, "text": "conditional election"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5276, "end": 5284, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5164, "end": 5166, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 5148, "end": 5156, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 5052, "end": 5054, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 5002, "end": 5021, "text": "Conditional election"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4990, "end": 4992, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 4930, "end": 4938, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 4885, "end": 4901, "text": "Arminian theology"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4833, "end": 4835, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4817, "end": 4819, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 4705, "end": 4713, "text": "salvation"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4589, "end": 4594, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 4514, "end": 4533, "text": "Conditional election"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4444, "end": 4449, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4380, "end": 4382, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 4300, "end": 4304, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4260, "end": 4262, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 4196, "end": 4215, "text": "Conditional election"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 4060, "end": 4193, "text": "But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.

{"content": "nWhat is Christian leadership? What should a Christian leader be like? There is no finer example for Christian leadership than our Lord Jesus Christ. He declared, 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep' (John 10:11). It is within this verse that we see the perfect description of a Christian leader. He is one who acts as a shepherd to those 'sheep' in his care. When Jesus referred to us as 'sheep,' He was not speaking in affectionate terms. In truth, sheep rank among the dumbest animals in creation. A stray sheep, still within earshot of the herd, becomes disoriented, confused, frightened, and incapable of finding its way back to the flock. Unable to ward off hungry predators, the stray is perhaps the most helpless of all creatures. Entire herds of sheep are known to have drowned during times of flash flooding even in sight of easily accessible higher ground. Like it or not, when Jesus called us His sheep, He was saying that without a shepherd, we are helpless. The shepherd is one who has several roles in regard to his sheep. He leads, feeds, nurtures, comforts, corrects and protects. The shepherd of the Lord's flock leads by modeling godliness and righteousness in his own life and encouraging others to follow his example. Of course, our ultimate example'and the One we should follow'is Christ Himself. The Apostle Paul understood this: 'Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ' (1 Corinthians 11:1). The Christian leader is one who follows Christ and inspires others to follow Him as well. The Christian leader is also a feeder and a nourisher of the sheep, and the ultimate 'sheep food' is the Word of God. Just as the shepherd leads his flock to the most lush pasture so they will grow and flourish, so the Christian leader nourishes his flock with the only food which will produce strong, vibrant Christians. The Bible'not psychology or the world's wisdom'is the only diet that can produce healthy Christians. 'Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD' (Deuteronomy 8:3). The Christian leader also comforts the sheep, binding up their wounds and applying the balm of compassion and love. As the great Shepherd of Israel, the Lord Himself promised to 'bind up the injured and strengthen the weak' (Ezekiel 34:16). As Christians in the world today, we suffer many injuries to our spirits, and we need compassionate leaders who will bear our burdens with us, sympathize with our circumstances, exhibit patience toward us, encourage us in the Word, and bring our concerns before the Father's throne. Just as the shepherd used his crook to pull a wandering sheep back into the fold, so the Christian leader corrects and disciplines those in his care when they go astray. Without rancor or an overbearing spirit, but with a 'spirit of gentleness' (Galatians 6:1), those in leadership must correct according to scriptural principles. Correction or discipline is never a pleasant experience for either party, but the Christian leader who fails in this area is not exhibiting love for those in his care. 'The LORD disciplines those he loves' (Proverbs 3:12), and the Christian leader must follow His example.  The final role of the Christian leader is that of protector. The shepherd who was lax in this area soon found that he regularly lost sheep to the predators who prowled around'and sometimes among'his flock. The predators today are those who try to lure the sheep away with false doctrine, dismissing the Bible as quaint and old fashioned, insufficient, unclear, or unknowable. These lies are spread by those against whom Jesus warned us: 'Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves' (Matthew 7:15). Our leaders must protect us from the false teachings of those who would lead us astray from the truth of the Scripture and the fact that Christ alone is the way of salvation: 'I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me' (John 14:6). A final word on Christian leaders comes from the article 'Wanted: A Few Good Shepherds (Must Know How to Wash Feet)' by John MacArthur: 'Under the plan God has ordained for the church, leadership is a position of humble, loving service. Church leadership is ministry, not management. Those whom God designates as leaders are called not to be governing monarchs, but humble slaves; not slick celebrities, but laboring servants. Those who would lead God's people must above all exemplify sacrifice, devotion, submission, and lowliness. Jesus Himself gave us the pattern when He stooped to wash His disciples' feet, a task that was customarily done by the lowest of slaves (John 13). If the Lord of the universe would do that, no church leader has a right to think of himself as a bigwig.'", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4744, "end": 4763, "text": "Lord of the universe"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 4727, "end": 4730, "text": "John"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4648, "end": 4650, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4629, "end": 4630, "text": "He"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4596, "end": 4602, "text": "Himself"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4590, "end": 4594, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4504, "end": 4506, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4351, "end": 4353, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4208, "end": 4210, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 4044, "end": 4047, "text": "John"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4013, "end": 4022, "text": "the Father"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3957, "end": 4041, "text": "'I am the way, the truth, and the life.

{"content": "n\nThere is no \u201cofficial\u201d Christian stand on Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. The biblical directive is, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself\u201d (James 2:8). This command has no exceptions; the Christian is to act in love toward someone with Asperger\u2019s in the same way that he acts in love toward everyone else. There are several biblical principles that could apply to some of the symptoms typically associated with Asperger\u2019s. Here are some tips: Be a friend (Proverbs 17:17). Don\u2019t ignore someone with Asperger\u2019s. Engage him or her in conversation and show a genuine interest in what he or she says, even if you don\u2019t completely understand the topic. If you are getting more information than you need, it\u2019s okay to politely inform your Aspie friend that you feel overwhelmed, but be careful not to show judgment or criticism. Advocate for those with Asperger\u2019s and don\u2019t allow others to belittle them. Be direct (Ephesians 4:15). Generally speaking, an Aspie does not readily pick up on communication cues such as gestures, tone of voice, and body language. Don\u2019t hint at things; be specific about how you feel and what you need. Be wise (James 1:5). Research Asperger\u2019s Syndrome to better understand the Aspie you\u2019re ministering to. At the same time, don\u2019t rely solely on third-party resources for your knowledge; get to know your Aspie friend personally and don\u2019t make assumptions about him or her. Those with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome generally like to keep to themselves. Know when to attempt to draw them into an activity and when it would be better to back off. Respect the Aspie\u2019s schedule and don\u2019t force unnecessary changes to his or her routine. Be loving (1 Peter 4:8). If \u201clove covers over all wrongs\u201d (Proverbs 10:12), then love can easily overlook the idiosyncrasies and quirks of the person with Asperger\u2019s. Bear each other\u2019s burdens and fulfill the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2). Follow the rule of love. Be prayerful (James 5:16). A Christian is to \u201cpray continually\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:19), so praying for a friend with Asperger\u2019s should come naturally. In Luke 10:29\u201337 Jesus tells of a man who gave aid to a stranger who had been beaten, robbed and left for dead. In Jesus\u2019 words, \u201cA Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him\u201d (verses 33\u201334). When Jesus\u2019 audience identified the Samaritan as a man who showed mercy, He said to them, \u201cGo and do likewise\u201d (verse 37). Clearly, we honor God by displaying Christian compassion and mercy toward others in times of need. Christians should be aware of the unique needs of those with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and be willing to demonstrate the love of God to encourage and uplift them.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2782, "end": 2784, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 2596, "end": 2604, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2578, "end": 2580, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2442, "end": 2446, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 2177, "end": 2419, "text": "\u201cA Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

{"content": "n\nGotQuestions.org was started in February of 2002. In late 2001, God gave our founder, S. Michael Houdmann, a passion for helping people find answers to their Bible questions through the internet. Little did he envision how quickly God would turn GotQuestions.org into a full-time ministry. He quickly discovered what a great need there was for a quality Bible answer service on the internet. Within one month of our launch, GotQuestions.org was receiving over 30 questions a day. We quickly recognized our need for help, so we began searching for volunteers to assist us in answering all of the questions we were receiving. The volunteer staff grew steadily, ultimately to our current team of over 250. At the same time, the volume of questions steadily increased. We are currently averaging 125 questions per day. We continue to praise the Lord for our volunteer writers. They are what makes this ministry possible! As our website traffic increased and the volume of questions continued to grow, we recognized the need to have our most frequently asked questions and answers posted online for easy and instant access. We currently have over 4,400 of our most frequently asked questions posted online in our archives. Now, the vast majority of GotQuestions.org's visitors find their answers in the online archives rather than by submitting a question to us. In May of 2002, we started posting a question of the week online and immediately received requests for it to be sent out via email as well. Our Question of the Week email now has approximately 350,000 subscribers.  The internet is a spiritual battlefield. Cults, false religions, and other pseudo-Christian groups have websites as well. Some of these sites perform much the same function that we do. The answers these sites provide are often unbiblical and lead searching people down a false path\u2014potentially to their own spiritual destruction. (Note: we by no means claim to be the only site on the internet that answers questions in a God-honoring way. In fact, there are many others.) So, we began to pray, how can we prevent people from visiting these unbiblical sites? In response to our prayers, God led us to search engine optimization. By designing our webpages to be search engine friendly, we achieve good rankings in the search engines. If anyone searches for anything Christian or Bible related, we want to be there near the top of the search engine results. We strive to be listed higher than the sites that do not proclaim the truth. God has blessed our efforts, as we knew He would (Philippians 4:19). The vast majority of our approximately 12,000,000 monthly visitors find us through the search engines. In November of 2005, we began the process of translating what we believe to be our most important webpages into other languages. It is our goal to translate our fifty 'most important' articles into every major world language. Beyond that, it is our goal to translate at least 200 webpages into all of the world languages that are most prominent on the internet. There are, sadly, many languages which have very little quality Christian content available online. Our articles have now been translated into 166 languages, with a total of 35,000 pages of translated content. In order to expand our impact, we have launched several other websites focused on different audiences. We launched our Christian research search engine - www.seekfind.org - in 2005. We launched our site for kids - www.gqkidz.org - in 2007. We launched our apologetics and worldview focused site - www.compellingtruth.org - and our blog site - www.blogos.org - in 2011. We launched our site for teens -www.412teens.org - in 2012. We launched our Bible Commentary site - www.bibleref.com - in 2016. We continue to pray and dream regarding how God would expand and improve the ministry of GotQuestions.org! We praise the Lord for what He has accomplished through us and in us! We look forward for how God will use GotQuestions.org in the futur", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3949, "end": 3951, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3883, "end": 3884, "text": "He"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3869, "end": 3872, "text": "Lord"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3792, "end": 3794, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 3763, "end": 3766, "text": "pray"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 3696, "end": 3700, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 3507, "end": 3517, "text": "apologetics"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 3370, "end": 3378, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 3105, "end": 3113, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2557, "end": 2567, "text": "Philippians"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2547, "end": 2548, "text": "He"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2507, "end": 2509, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2352, "end": 2356, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 2339, "end": 2347, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2161, "end": 2163, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 2152, "end": 2157, "text": "prayer"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 2063, "end": 2066, "text": "pray"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1996, "end": 1998, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 1656, "end": 1664, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 1649, "end": 1664, "text": "pseudo-Christian"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 1622, "end": 1636, "text": "false religions"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 1615, "end": 1619, "text": "Cults"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 842, "end": 845, "text": "Lord"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 355, "end": 359, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 291, "end": 292, "text": "He"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 232, "end": 234, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 159, "end": 163, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 65, "end": 67, "text": "God"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541276524000, "last_updated_at": 1541276524000, "sec_taken": 684, "last_updated_by": "yajT2EOX1bUmgVyczHYADROwamF3", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
{"content": "nReplacement theology (also known as supersessionism) essentially teaches that the church has replaced Israel in God\u2019s plan. Adherents of replacement theology believe the Jews are no longer God\u2019s chosen people, and God does not have specific future plans for the nation of Israel. Among the different views of the relationship between the church and Israel are the church has replaced Israel (replacement theology), the church is an expansion of Israel (covenant theology), or the church is completely different and distinct from Israel (dispensationalism/premillennialism). Replacement theology teaches that the church is the replacement for Israel and that the many promises made to Israel in the Bible are fulfilled in the Christian church, not in Israel. The prophecies in Scripture concerning the blessing and restoration of Israel to the Promised Land are spiritualized or allegorized into promises of God\u2019s blessing for the church. Major problems exist with this view, such as the continuing existence of the Jewish people throughout the centuries and especially with the revival of the modern state of Israel. If Israel has been condemned by God and there is no future for the Jewish nation, how do we explain the supernatural survival of the Jewish people over the past 2,000 years despite the many attempts to destroy them? How do we explain why and how Israel reappeared as a nation in the 20th century after not existing for 1,900 years? The view that Israel and the church are different is clearly taught in the New Testament. Biblically speaking, the church is distinct from Israel, and the terms church and Israel are never to be confused or used interchangeably. We are taught from Scripture that the church is an entirely new creation that came into being on the day of Pentecost and will continue until it is taken to heaven at the rapture (Ephesians 1:9\u201311; 1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201317). The church has no relationship to the curses and blessings for Israel. The covenants, promises, and warnings of the Mosaic Covenant were valid only for Israel. Israel has been temporarily set aside in God\u2019s program during these past 2,000 years of dispersion (see Romans 11). Contrary to replacement theology, dispensationalism teaches that, after the rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201318), God will restore Israel as the primary focus of His plan. The first event at this time is the tribulation (Revelation chapters 6\u201319). The world will be judged for rejecting Christ, while Israel is prepared through the trials of the great tribulation for the second coming of the Messiah. Then, when Christ does return to the earth at the end of the tribulation, Israel will be ready to receive Him. The remnant of Israel who survive the tribulation will be saved, and the Lord will establish His kingdom on this earth with Jerusalem as its capital. With Christ reigning as King, Israel will be the leading nation, and representatives from all nations will come to Jerusalem to honor and worship the King\u2014Jesus Christ. The church will return with Christ and will reign with Him for a literal thousand years (Revelation 20:1\u20135). Both the Old Testament and the New Testament support a premillennial/dispensational understanding of God\u2019s plan for Israel. The strongest support for premillennialism is found in the clear teaching of Revelation 20:1\u20137, where it says six times that Christ\u2019s kingdom will last 1,000 years. After the tribulation the Lord will return and establish His kingdom with the nation of Israel, Christ will reign over the whole earth, and Israel will be the leader of the nations. The church will reign with Him for a literal thousand years. The church has not replaced Israel in God's plan. While God may be focusing His attention primarily on the church in this dispensation of grace, God has not forgotten Israel and will one day restore Israel to His intended role as the nation He has chosen (Romans 11).", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3856, "end": 3858,

{"content": "nPauline Christianity is a term applied to what some perceive as the religious teaching unique to Paul\u2019s writings and distinct from the gospel of Jesus. That is, Jesus taught one thing, and Paul taught something completely different. Those who believe in a separate Pauline Christianity believe that the Christianity of today has little to do with Jesus\u2019 teachings; rather, it is the product of Paul\u2019s corruption of those teachings.We believe that the New Testament is a unified whole: the Gospels present the life and work of Jesus the Messiah; the Epistles explain the meaning and scope of Jesus\u2019 work and apply it to daily living. For example, Matthew 28 narrates the fact of Jesus\u2019 resurrection, and 1 Corinthians 15 explains the significance of His resurrection. Mark 15:38 tells of the temple veil being torn in two when Jesus died; Hebrews 10:11-23 reveals the import of that event. The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Gospels also inspired the Epistles to give us a fuller understanding of God\u2019s plan of salvation.However, those who theorize about a separate \u201cPauline Christianity\u201d tell a different story:Jesus, a great teacher, considered himself to be the long-awaited Messiah for the Jews. He believed that God would overthrow Rome and bring His kingdom to earth. In preparation for this, Jesus taught a message of unconditional love, tolerance, and non-judgmental acceptance of everyone. Alas, Jesus\u2019 mission of inaugurating a new earthly age failed when the Romans crucified him.Jesus\u2019 followers, believing that God had raised their rabbi from the dead, continued to meet in Jerusalem under the leadership of James, Jesus\u2019 brother. Their intention was to await the still-coming kingdom and continue observing Jesus\u2019 brand of enlightened Judaism. But along came Saul of Tarsus, who faked a conversion in order to infiltrate the church. Peter and James and others who had actually known Jesus were suspicious of Saul, who had never met Jesus. Then Saul, who started calling himself \u201cPaul,\u201d had a stroke of genius. He artfully combined traditional Hebrew ideas with those of pagan Greek philosophy, creating a new religion that could appeal to both Jews and Gentiles. He began preaching that Jesus was actually God, that Jesus\u2019 death was linked to the Jewish system of sacrifice, that one could be saved by simply believing, and that the Mosaic law was obsolete. Paul\u2019s zealous missionary activity and persuasive writings took his new \u201cgospel\u201d around the Roman Empire. The Jerusalem Church, including Peter and James, disowned Paul as a heretic and cult leader.After the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, the Jewish Church lost authority, but the Gentile Church founded by Paul increased its influence. One of Paul\u2019s fervent followers wrote the book of Acts, which gave Paul legendary status with its glowing portrayal of him as the hero of the church. Later, four unknown writers gathered scraps of information about Jesus and wrote books they called \u201cMatthew,\u201d \u201cMark,\u201d Luke,\u201d and \u201cJohn\u201d\u2014but Paul\u2019s theology, already dominant in the church, tainted the writers\u2019 perspective. Thus, Paul\u2019s religion won out over Jesus\u2019 religion.In short, Paul was a charlatan, an evangelical huckster who succeeded in twisting Jesus\u2019 message of love into something Jesus himself would never recognize. It was Paul, not Jesus, who originated the \u201cChristianity\u201d of today.Commonly, those who hold to the above theory also believe the following:1) Jesus was not divine. He never claimed to be God, and he never intended to start a new religion.2) The Bible is not an inspired book and is riddled with contradictions. None of the Bible, except possibly the book of James, was written by anyone who knew Jesus. There are fragments of Jesus\u2019 teachings in the Gospels, but it is difficult to discern what he really said.3) Paul was never a Pharisee and was not highly educated. His \u201cconversion\u201d was either a personal hallucinogenic experience or an outright fraud. His claims to be an apostle were attempts to further his own authority in the church.4) Pauline theological \u201cinventions\u201d include a) the deity of Jesus; b) salvation by grace through faith; c) salvation through the blood of Jesus; d) the sinless nature of Jesus; e) the concept of original sin; and f) the Holy Spirit. None of these \u201cnew doctrines\u201d were accepted by Jesus\u2019 true followers.5) The Gnostic Gospels are closer to the truth about Jesus than are the traditional four Gospels of the Bible. The concept of \u201cPauline Christianity\u201d represents an outright attack on the Bible as the Word of God. Adherents of the \u201cPauline Christianity\u201d theory are truly misrepresenting Jesus\u2019 teachings. They choose to believe His words on love but deny His teachings on judgment (such as Matthew 24). They insist on a human Jesus, denying His divinity, although Jesus plainly taught His equality with God in passages such as John 10:30. They want a \u201cloving\u201d Jesus without having to accept Him as Lord and Savior.Any time a skeptic finds a \u201cdisagreeable\u201d doctrine in the Bible, he is likely to say, \u201cThat passage has been corrupted,\u201d or, \u201cPaul wrote that, and we know he was a liar.\u201d Where the Gospels teach a \u201cPauline\u201d doctrine, such as Jesus\u2019 atonement for sin in John 1:29, the skeptic dismisses it as \u201cinserted by devotees of Paul.\u201d In reality, the skeptic\u2019s only basis for such a selective approach to Scripture is a personal bias against the idea of Jesus\u2019 atonement.Interestingly, Paul\u2019s credentials as an apostle were attacked, even in his own lifetime, by those who desired to lead the church into legalism and other errant ideologies. Paul defends himself from the spurious attacks of false teachers in 1 Corinthians 9; 2 Corinthians 12; and Galatians 1. Paul\u2019s apostleship is attested to by the miracles he performed (Romans 15:19), the training he received (Galatians 1:15-20), and the testimony of the other apostles. Peter, far from being Paul\u2019s enemy, wrote this about him: \u201cOur dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction\u201d (2 Peter 3:15-16).",

{"content": "n\nAn Easter Vigil, also called the Paschal Vigil or the Great Vigil of Easter, is a liturgical tradition mainly celebrated in Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches. The Easter vigil is the culmination of a 40-day-long observance of Lent, a solemn practice wherein participants give up some habit or item as a form of self-denial. The Easter Vigil takes place after sundown on the night before Easter (i.e., Holy Saturday) or immediately after the Good Friday service (in Oriental Orthodoxy). The Easter Vigil is generally seen as the most important service of the year, particularly in Catholic and Orthodox churches. This service celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and it is also a time when new members are baptized into the church or current members are given a chance to renew their baptismal vows. With the exception of Oriental Orthodoxy, which follows a different pattern, most liturgical churches break the Easter Vigil into four parts: the Service of Light begins the celebration, followed by the reading of the Word of God (called the Liturgy of the Word or Service of Lessons or Service of the Word), then the baptismal ceremony, and lastly the Eucharist (the Mass in Catholicism or communion in some other churches). Candles play a big part in the Service of Light, and a fire may be blessed and the Paschal or Easter candle lit. The readings from the Word are taken from various parts of the Bible from Genesis to the Gospels and highlight God\u2019s work from Creation to Christ\u2019s resurrection. The baptismal portion confirms adults into the church or serves as a confirmation for previous baptisms, and, finally, the congregation partakes of the Lord\u2019s Table during the Eucharist. While much of the celebration of an Easter Vigil is not unbiblical, there are a few things for Christians to remember. First of all, an Easter Vigil most often follows a strict liturgy, which is full of ritual and recitations and can result in a static service that may or may not allow for the work of the Holy Spirit. In addition, baptism does not gain salvation for participants. Baptism is intended as an outward sign to all that a person has accepted Christ and as a picture of Christ\u2019s own death and resurrection (Matthew 28:19; Romans 6:4; Colossians 2:12). Also, the ritualistic blessing of fire and water and candles is unbiblical, and the Mass in Catholicism is an idolatrous re-sacrificing of the body of Christ.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2463, "end": 2468, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 2404, "end": 2411, "text": "Catholic"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2230, "end": 2235, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2203, "end": 2208, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["holy_spirit"], "points": [{"start": 2054, "end": 2064, "text": "Holy Spirit"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1883, "end": 1894, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1883, "end": 1888, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1842, "end": 1847, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1783, "end": 1794, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1783, "end": 1788, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1736, "end": 1744, "text": "Eucharist"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1537, "end": 1542, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1509, "end": 1511, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1461, "end": 1465, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1379, "end": 1384, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1250, "end": 1258, "text": "communion"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 1235, "end": 1242, "text": "Catholic"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1212, "end": 1220, "text": "Eucharist"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1177, "end": 1194, "text": "baptismal ceremony"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1101, "end": 1119, "text": "Liturgy of the Word"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1085, "end": 1087, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 1062, "end": 1080, "text": "reading of the Word"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 971, "end": 982, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 971, "end": 976, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 881, "end": 897, "text": "Oriental Orthodox"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 714, "end": 719, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 708, "end": 719, "text": "Jesus Christ"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 708, "end": 712, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 632, "end": 639, "text": "Catholic"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 542, "end": 553, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 542, "end": 547, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 517, "end": 533, "text": "Oriental Orthodox"}]}, {"label": ["church_history_events"], "points": [{"start": 493, "end": 503, "text": "Good Friday"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 439, "end": 444, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 380, "end": 391, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 380, "end": 385, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 252, "end": 281, "text": "40-day-long observance of Lent"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 215, "end": 220, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 183, "end": 199, "text": "Oriental Orthodox"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 161, "end": 176, "text": "Eastern Orthodox"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 151, "end": 158, "text": "Lutheran"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 141, "end": 148, "text": "Anglican"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 131, "end": 138, "text": "Catholic"}]}, {"label": ["denominations"], "points": [{"start": 125, "end": 138, "text": "Roman Catholic"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 70, "end": 75, "text": "Easter"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 4, "end": 15, "text": "Easter Vigil"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 4, "end": 9, "text": "Easter"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541293705000, "last_updated_at": 1541293705000, "sec_taken": 206, "last_updated_by": "xDPdj3DraCaPxIDu0WPn8X4MNDX2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
{"content": "\nIt does seem odd, given the apostle Paul\u2019s exhortation in 1 Thessalonians 5:17\u201318 to \u201cpray without ceasing\u201d and to \u201cgive thanks in all circumstances,\u201d that the Lord\u2019s Prayer does not include instructions for thanksgiving. It seems especially odd since Jesus models thanksgiving in prayer elsewhere in the Gospels. Jesus thanks God for the meals that He provides, including the miraculous feeding of the 5,000 (Matthew 14:16\u201321) and the 4,000 (Matthew 15:35\u201338). He gave thanks for the cup and the bread at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26\u201327). He thanked God for hearing His request to raise Lazarus from the dead (John 11:41). He even thanked the Father from keeping the secrets of the kingdom from the wise and revealing them to the poor, the ignorant, and the obscure (Matthew 11:25). Yet He leaves thanksgiving out of the Lord\u2019s Prayer. If we examine the passage containing the Lord\u2019s Prayer (Matthew 6:9\u201313), we first note why Jesus was teaching the disciples to pray a certain way. Jesus was critiquing the way the Pharisees prayed. They prayed out in the open where all could see and hear. This was a way to show the public how holy and pious they were. Jesus condemns this way of praying: \u201cThey have their reward,\u201d the reward of being seen by men. Jesus is not condemning public prayer, only the practice of praying with the goal of being \u201cseen by men.\u201d We also see Jesus critiquing the way the Gentiles prayed by constantly praying the same thing over and over again as if to make sure their god heard them, such as the priests of Baal on Mount Carmel in 1 Kings 18. Jesus\u2019 corrective against these modes of prayer was to give His disciples a model prayer. Now, we don\u2019t pray the Lord\u2019s Prayer by simply reciting it, as do the Roman Catholics. This does not mean that corporate recital of the Lord\u2019s Prayer is wrong. Jesus is referring to private prayer here, not corporate prayer. It\u2019s best to think of the Lord\u2019s Prayer as a general guideline for prayer\u2014a means to shape our prayer life. The prayer contains six petitions. The first three relate to God, and the last three relate to us. After addressing God as \u201cour Father in heaven,\u201d we first pray that God\u2019s name be honored and glorified. Next, we pray that God\u2019s kingdom will come. There is a sense in which God\u2019s kingdom is already present since the advent of Christ, but we pray for the kingdom to come in its fullness. Third, we pray for God\u2019s will \u2013 His moral, or revealed, will \u2013 to be done here on earth, starting with us. After these three petitions, which address God\u2019s glory and majesty, we continue with the petitions that pertain to us\u2014our daily provision, our forgiveness from sin, and our deliverance from evil. As for why we don\u2019t find thanksgiving in the Lord\u2019s Prayer, the best answer is that thanksgiving is the attitude in which we pray to God. For those who are children of God, thanksgiving will fill our hearts and pour forth from our lips to God because we know, among other things, our sins are forgiven and we have eternal life through Jesus Christ. The more we contemplate what God has done for us, the more thankful we will be. Thanksgiving becomes natural in our relationship with God at all times, under all conditions, and in all circumstances.

{"content": "\nAbortion healing and recovery is possible. Having an abortion and regretting it later is a common experience felt by women. While what has been done cannot be undone, you can experience healing and recovery after an abortion. The God of all comfort and healing is more than able to ease the sorrow and pain of an abortion. He can restore you to life and joy. An unwanted pregnancy can be a frightening experience for someone who is not financially, emotionally, or physically prepared for such a responsibility. Perhaps you are one of the many women and teenage girls who are scared, confused, and desperate. In your search for answers, perhaps you were fooled into believing that your unborn child was an expendable \u201clump of tissue,\u201d not really a pre-born human being. Often the realization of the truth comes later, in the form of post-abortion stress syndrome, guilt, and depression. This is where abortion healing and recovery is essential. There is good news for anyone who has had an abortion, and that is that God offers forgiveness to anyone who asks for it. Abortion healing and abortion recovery begin with accepting that forgiveness. Romans 3:22 says, \u201cWe are made right in God\u2019s sight when we trust in Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we all can be saved in this same way, no matter who we are or what we have done.\u201d It is never too late to come to God for healing. There is nothing we can do that is so bad that it is unforgivable. God offers this forgiveness, through Christ, and with it He offers peace of mind and heart. Abortion recovery is yours if you will only receive it by putting your faith in Jesus, allowing Him permanent residence and authority in your life. Perhaps you are already a Christian, yet you decided to have an abortion, perhaps out of fear of how you would be perceived by the Christian community. Even if you understood how God feels about abortion, you may have felt, out of desperation, that you must get rid of the \u201cevidence.\u201d Please understand that abortion recovery is available. God is ready to offer forgiveness, redemption, healing, and restoration. Yes, having an abortion was wrong; it was the taking of a life, but it is not unforgivable. The Bible says that there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1), and so, when we confess our sins to Him, He freely forgives (1 John 1:9). This is not because we deserve forgiveness but because of the loving nature of our Lord. When you realize the repercussions of having an abortion, you may find it difficult to forgive yourself. But God does not want us to live with perpetual guilt; He wants us to learn from our mistakes and use them to His advantage, as well as our own. Abortion healing and recovery will provide freedom from guilt. It will require a lot of prayer, which is simply conversation with God. This and studying the Bible help us get to know God better so that we can trust Him to heal us and be better equipped to do His work. Instead of dwelling on your choice to have an abortion, be encouraged to use your experience to help others. You may need to seek Christian counseling to help get through the experience. But through the healing process, if you trust in the Lord, you will be stronger and more spiritually mature. You can experience abortion healing and abortion recovery! You will have gone through an experience that God is able to use to strengthen your character and prepare you for ministering to others.

{"content": "\nScribes in ancient Israel were learned men whose business was to study the Law, transcribe it, and write commentaries on it. They were also hired on occasions when the need for a written document arose or when an interpretation of a legal point was needed. Ezra, \u201ca teacher well versed in the Law of Moses,\u201d was a scribe (Ezra 7:6).The scribes took their job of preserving Scripture very seriously; they would copy and recopy the Bible meticulously, even counting letters and spaces to ensure each copy was correct. We can thank the Jewish scribes for preserving the Old Testament portion of our Bibles.Jews became increasingly known as \u201cthe people of the Book\u201d because of their faithful study of Scripture, particularly the Law and how it should be followed. In the New Testament era, scribes were often associated with the sect of the Pharisees, although not all Pharisees were scribes (see Matthew 5:20; 12:38). They were teachers of the people (Mark 1:22) and interpreters of the Law. They were widely respected by the community because of their knowledge, dedication, and outward appearance of Law-keeping.The scribes went beyond interpretation of Scripture, however, and added many man-made traditions to what God had said. They became professionals at spelling out the letter of the Law while ignoring the spirit behind it. Things became so bad that the regulations and traditions the scribes added to the Law were considered more important than the Law itself. This led to many confrontations between Jesus and the Pharisees and scribes. At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus shocked His audience by declaring that the righteousness of the scribes was not enough to get anyone to heaven (Matthew 5:20). A large portion of Jesus\u2019 sermon then dealt with what the people had been taught (by the scribes) and what God actually wanted (Matthew 5:21\u201348). Toward the end of Jesus\u2019 ministry, He thoroughly condemned the scribes for their hypocrisy (Matthew 23). They knew the Law, and they taught it to others, but they did not obey it.The scribes\u2019 original aim was in earnest\u2014to know and preserve the Law and encourage others to keep it. But things turned horribly wrong when man-made traditions overshadowed God\u2019s Word and a pretense of holiness replaced a life of true godliness. The scribes, whose stated goal was to preserve the Word, actuallynullifiedit by the traditions they handed down (Mark 7:13).How did things get so far off course? Probably because the Jews, after surviving centuries of persecution and enslavement, clung in pride to the keeping of the Law and how it marked them as God\u2019s chosen people. The Jews of Jesus\u2019 day certainly had an attitude of superiority (John 7:49), which Jesus opposed (Matthew 9:12). The bigger problem was that the scribes were hypocrites at heart. They were more interested in appearing good to men than they were in pleasing God. Eventually, it was these same scribes who played a part in having Jesus arrested and crucified (Matthew 26:57; Mark 15:1; Luke 22:1\u20132). The lesson every Christian can learn from the hypocrisy of the scribes is that God wants more than outward acts of righteousness. He wants an inward change of heart that is constantly yielding in love and obedience to Christ.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 3247, "end": 3252, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3092, "end": 3098, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 3046, "end": 3051, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3004, "end": 3007, "text": "Mark"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2959, "end": 2963, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2923, "end": 2929, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2776, "end": 2782, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2714, "end": 2718, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2643, "end": 2647, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2610, "end": 2628, "text": "God\u2019s chosen people"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2610, "end": 2614, "text": "God\u2019s"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2409, "end": 2412, "text": "Mark"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2300, "end": 2306, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2223, "end": 2227, "text": "God\u2019s"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2053, "end": 2059, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1933, "end": 1939, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1888, "end": 1892, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1813, "end": 1819, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1743, "end": 1747, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1661, "end": 1667, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1591, "end": 1595, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["church_history_events"], "points": [{"start": 1570, "end": 1588, "text": "Sermon on the Mount"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1537, "end": 1543, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1523, "end": 1531, "text": "Pharisees"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1509, "end": 1513, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1392, "end": 1398, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1153, "end": 1161, "text": "Scripture"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1115, "end": 1121, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 949, "end": 952, "text": "Mark"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 880, "end": 886, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 865, "end": 873, "text": "Pharisees"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 837, "end": 845, "text": "Pharisees"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 786, "end": 792, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 697, "end": 705, "text": "Scripture"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 596, "end": 600, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 540, "end": 546, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 430, "end": 434, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 373, "end": 381, "text": "Scripture"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 336, "end": 342, "text": "scribes"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 322, "end": 325, "text": "Ezra"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 300, "end": 304, "text": "Moses"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 293, "end": 304, "text": "Law of Moses"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 257, "end": 260, "text": "Ezra"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "text": "Scribes"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541276768000, "last_updated_at": 1541276768000, "sec_taken": 410, "last_updated_by": "xDPdj3DraCaPxIDu0WPn8X4MNDX2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "nKnowing how to study the Bible is important, because determining the meaning of Scripture is one of the most important tasks a believer has in this life. God does not tell us that we must simply read the Bible. We must study it and handle it correctly (2 Timothy 2:15). Studying the Scriptures is hard work. A cursory or brief scanning of Scripture can sometimes yield very wrong conclusions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand several principles for determining the correct meaning of Scripture. First, the one who would study the Bible must pray and ask the Holy Spirit to impart understanding, for that is one of His functions. \u201cBut when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come\u201d (John 16:13). Just as the Holy Spirit guided the apostles in the writing of the New Testament, He also guides us in the understanding of Scripture. The Bible is God\u2019s book, and we need to ask Him what it means. If you are a Christian, the author of Scripture\u2014the Holy Spirit\u2014dwells inside you, and He wants you to understand what He wrote. Second, to study the Bible properly, we cannot pull a verse out of the verses that surround it and try to determine the meaning of the verse outside of the context. We should always read the surrounding verses and chapters to discern the context. While all of Scripture comes from God (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21), God used men to write it down. These men had a theme in mind, a purpose for writing, and a specific issue they were addressing. To study the Bible, we should understand the background of the book we are studying: it\u2019s helpful to know who wrote the book, to whom it was written, when it was written, and why it was written. Also, we should take care to let the text speak for itself. Sometimes people will assign their own meanings to words in order to get the interpretation they desire. Third, to study the Bible properly, we should not think of ourselves as totally independent in our analysis of the text. It is arrogant to think that we cannot gain understanding through the lifelong work of others who have studied Scripture. Some people, in error, approach the Bible with the idea that they will depend on the Holy Spirit alone and they will discover all the hidden truths of Scripture. Christ, in the giving of the Holy Spirit, has given people with spiritual gifts to the body of Christ. One of these spiritual gifts is that of teaching (Ephesians 4:11\u201312; 1 Corinthians 12:28). These teachers are given by the Lord to help us to correctly understand and obey Scripture. It is always wise to study the Bible with other believers, assisting each other in understanding and applying the truth of God\u2019s Word. So, in summary, the proper way to study the Bible is to prayerfully and humbly rely on the Holy Spirit to give us understanding; study verses in their context, recognizing that the Bible explains itself; and respect the efforts of other Christians, past and present, who have also sought to properly study the Bible.

{"content": "n\nThe behemoth is a large animal mentioned in Job 40:15\u201324 as God addresses Job. God\u2019s description of this animal focuses on its great size and strength in comparison to Job\u2019s smallness and human frailty. Modern language has picked up on the biblical description and uses the word behemoth to mean \u201canything of monstrous size or power.\u201d The way the behemoth is described in Job 40 gives us the idea that this animal, familiar to Job, was an unstoppable, fearless creature. It\u2019s impossible to identify what species the behemoth is, but we do know this: the behemoth is a plant-eater (Job 40:15) that lives near water (verses 21\u201323). It is at home even in a flooded, raging river (verse 23). The behemoth is very strong and muscular (verses 16, 18); in fact, \u201cit ranks first among the works of God\u201d (verse 19), and only its Creator can master it. The behemoth has a massive tail that \u201csways like a cedar\u201d (verse 17). Hunting the behemoth is futile, because it cannot be captured (verse 24). Some commentators identify the behemoth as a hippopotamus, a rhinoceros, or an elephant. However, the description of its cedar-like tail in Job 40:17 hardly fits the stubby or rope-like tails of those animals. Another theory is that Job 40 describes a type of dinosaur such as a diplodocus or an apatosaurus. Such sauropods were the largest of all land animals (ten times heavier than elephants), were marsh-loving plant-eaters, had tails like trees, and could truly be called \u201ckings\u201d of the animals. The Bible teaches that animals, which must have included Behemoth, were created on the same day as man (Genesis 1:24\u201327; Job 40:15). We don\u2019t know when the dinosaurs became extinct, and it\u2019s scripturally possible that some still remained in Job\u2019s day, which was sometime between Genesis 11 (the tower of Babel) and Genesis 12 (the call of Abraham). As Job sought to justify himself and demand an answer from God concerning his troubles, God shows up in the whirlwind (Job 38:1) and speaks directly to Job. In the end, it is God who does the questioning: \u201cBrace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me\u201d (Job 38:3). To help Job remember his place in the world, God points him to two of the mightiest creatures: the behemoth on land and the leviathan in the sea. These animals were incredibly powerful and frightening to behold. They were no one\u2019s pets\u2014except for God\u2019s. The pride and glory of man paled in comparison to the dreadful, untamable strength of the behemoth and the leviathan. How much more humble is man in God\u2019s presence? And that\u2019s the point. Neither Job nor anyone else has the right to criticize God\u2019s work. The One who created Behemoth is worthy of our reverence, awe, and worship. \u201cWill the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!\u201d (Job 40:2).", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2808, "end": 2810, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2790, "end": 2792, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2625, "end": 2627, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2578, "end": 2580, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2532, "end": 2534, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 2473, "end": 2480, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2376, "end": 2378, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 2228, "end": 2235, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2174, "end": 2176, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2137, "end": 2139, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2118, "end": 2120, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2013, "end": 2015, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1990, "end": 1992, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1957, "end": 1959, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1926, "end": 1928, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1897, "end": 1899, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1841, "end": 1843, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1730, "end": 1732, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1610, "end": 1612, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1221, "end": 1223, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1128, "end": 1130, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 1019, "end": 1026, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 926, "end": 933, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 848, "end": 855, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 791, "end": 793, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 693, "end": 700, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 582, "end": 584, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 555, "end": 562, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 517, "end": 524, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 428, "end": 430, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 373, "end": 375, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 348, "end": 355, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 280, "end": 287, "text": "behemoth"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 169, "end": 171, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 80, "end": 82, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 75, "end": 77, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 61, "end": 63, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 45, "end": 47, "text": "Job"}]}, {"label": ["mythological_creatures"], "points": [{"start": 5, "end": 12, "text": "behemoth"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541282080000, "last_updated_at": 1541282080000, "sec_taken": 79, "last_updated_by": "xDPdj3DraCaPxIDu0WPn8X4MNDX2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "The closest thing Scripture says to there being different levels of heaven is found in 2 Corinthians 12:2, \u201cI know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know\u2014God knows.\u201d Some interpret this as indicating that there are three different levels of heaven, a level for \u201csuper-committed Christians\u201d or Christians who have obtained a high level of spirituality, a level for \u201cordinary\u201d Christians, and a level for Christians who did not serve God faithfully. This view has no basis in Scripture. Paul is not saying that there are three heavens or even three levels of heaven. In many ancient cultures, people used the term heaven to describe three different \u201crealms\u201d\u2014the sky, outer space, and then a spiritual heaven. Paul was saying that God took him to the \u201cspiritual\u201d heaven\u2014the realm beyond the physical universe where God dwells. The concept of different levels of heaven may have come in part from Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy in which the poet describes both heaven and hell as having nine different levels. The Divine Comedy, however, is a fictional work. The idea of different levels of heaven is foreign to Scripture. Scripture does speak of different rewards in heaven. Jesus said regarding rewards, \u201cBehold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done\u201d (Revelation 22:12). Since Jesus will be distributing rewards on the basis of what we have done, we can safely say that there will be a time of reward for believers and that the rewards will differ somewhat from person to person. Only those works that survive God\u2019s refining fire have eternal value and will be worthy of reward. Those valuable works are referred to as \u201cgold, silver, and costly stones\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:12) and are those things that are built upon the foundation of faith in Christ. Those works that will not be rewarded are called \u201cwood, hay, and stubble\u201d; these are not evil deeds but shallow activities with no eternal value. Rewards will be distributed at the \u201cjudgment seat of Christ,\u201d a place where believers\u2019 lives will be evaluated for the purpose of rewards. \u201cJudgment\u201d of believers never refers to punishment for sin.

{"content": "\nIn addition to Jesus Himself being raised from the dead, the Bible records nine other instances of people rising from the dead (1 Kings 17:22; 2 Kings 4:33\u201336; 13:21; Matthew 27:52; Luke 7:11\u201317; 8:40\u201356; John 11:43\u201344; Acts 9:40\u201341; 20:9\u201312). Clearly, bringing someone back from the dead is not beyond God\u2019s power today: \u201cJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever\u201d (Hebrews 13:8). Since God is still capable of raising the dead, yes, raising the dead is still possible today. A much more involved question is whether raising the dead actually occurs today. There are some in the Word-Faith movement who claim to have raised the dead, but credible evidence has never been produced. The many blatantly unbiblical teachings within the Word-Faith movement raise serious doubts regarding the legitimacy of any of their miracles. Some practitioners of voodoo and witchcraft also claim to have raised people from the dead. While satanic miracles are possible (2 Thessalonians 2:9), it seems unlikely that Satan possesses the power to raise the dead.If a person who was officially pronounced dead was raised back to life, it would be an amazing miracle. Surely if a person was raised from the dead in the name of Christ, it would convince everyone to receive Jesus as Savior. Right? Wrong. Jesus addressed this very issue in Luke 16:30-31, \u201cBut if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. . . . If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.\u201d Why does raising the dead probably not occur today? Amazing miracles are not what lead people to genuine faith. If a person is rejecting the Word of God, no miracle will convince the person to repent and receive Jesus Christ as Savior.

{"content": "\nMatthew's genealogy traces the ancestors of Joseph, the legal father of Jesus. The structure of the genealogy descends from father to son, beginning with Abraham. Additionally, Matthew divides the genealogy into three groups of fourteen generations, separated by important historic points (Matthew 1:17). Matthew abridged the genealogy by omitting some names that appear in earlier records. Some speculate that the abridged arrangement was intended to aid in memorization. Genealogical abridgement has lots of biblical precedent. The wording of Matthew 1:17 has caused some to suggest that David's name is included in both the first and second grouping of generations. Notice, \"So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations...\" The writer does not express his intent to reveal 42 generations from Abraham to Jesus, but rather three segments of Jewish history, each comprised of 14 generations. It is plausible that David's name being mentioned twice (v 17) indicates his inclusion in both the first and second groupings. If so, then the first begins with Abraham and ends with David, 14 generations; the second begins with David and ends with Josiah, 14 generations; and the third begins with Jeconiah and ends with Jesus, 14 generations. In the listing of Jesus' forefathers, there is a name missing. Excluded from the list is Jehoiakim (a.k.a. Eliakim), who was Josiah's son and Jeconiah's father (1 Chronicles 3:15-16). The reason for his exclusion may be that he was a puppet king, given his rule by the Pharaoh of Egypt. The first phase of the captivity of Judah by Babylon began at the end of Jehoiakim's reign, prior to his son Jeconiah coming into power. Thus, the 3 groupings of 14 generations would include: 1. Abraham to David; 2. Solomon to Jehoiakim (he is not mentioned, but was among the first to be carried off into Babylon); 3. Jeconiah to Jesus. There may be other possible explanations for the existence of only 41 names in the genealogy of Matthew 1, even though verse 17 speaks of three groupings of 14. Regardless, these two suffice to demonstrate that there is not a contradiction. Many commentators believe that the divisions of 14 generations is simply a literary structure by Matthew not intended to set forth a strict biological lineage. God did not arrange Israel\u2019s history so nicely that there were exactly 14 biological generations between these three crucial moments in salvation history. One suggestion is that in 1 Chronicles 1\u20132 there are 14 generations listed between Abraham and David and from that Matthew structured the rest of the genealogy according to the number 14. The purpose of a genealogy is to document the proof of ancestry from the origin of the line to the person under discussion. Every individual need not be included, but only those necessary to establish descending relationship. The author may legitimately abridge a genealogy to establish a point or to make it simpler. Matthew is correct in the factual material for his purpose, which is to document the ancestry of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, from Abraham.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3147, "end": 3153, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 3115, "end": 3126, "text": "Jesus Christ"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3018, "end": 3024, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2627, "end": 2633, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2607, "end": 2611, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2595, "end": 2601, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2357, "end": 2359, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2294, "end": 2300, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2052, "end": 2058, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1949, "end": 1953, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1937, "end": 1944, "text": "Jeconiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1845, "end": 1853, "text": "Jehoiakim"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1824, "end": 1828, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1813, "end": 1819, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1727, "end": 1734, "text": "Jeconiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1691, "end": 1699, "text": "Jehoiakim"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 1641, "end": 1669, "text": "captivity of Judah by Babylon"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1600, "end": 1615, "text": "Pharaoh of Egypt"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1473, "end": 1480, "text": "Jeconiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1456, "end": 1461, "text": "Josiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1420, "end": 1428, "text": "Jehoiakim"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1349, "end": 1353, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1308, "end": 1312, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1285, "end": 1292, "text": "Jeconiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1235, "end": 1240, "text": "Josiah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1215, "end": 1219, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1169, "end": 1173, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1147, "end": 1153, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 900, "end": 904, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 889, "end": 895, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 770, "end": 789, "text": "captivity in Babylon"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 754, "end": 758, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 706, "end": 712, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 590, "end": 594, "text": "David"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 510, "end": 517, "text": "biblical"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 305, "end": 311, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 177, "end": 183, "text": "Matthew"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 154, "end": 160, "text": "Abraham"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 72, "end": 76, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 44, "end": 48, "text": "Josep"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "text": "Matthew"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541283113000, "last_updated_at": 1541283113000, "sec_taken": 288, "last_updated_by": "zRpwhN8op5VLgO5qS85ODIkvQSY2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "n\nThe saying \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d is an idiom that basically means \u201cwhat goes around comes around.\u201d More to the point, \u201cif you use violent, forceful, or underhanded methods against other people, you can expect those same methods to be used against you.\u201d The proverb \u201clive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d has a biblical origin. It comes from a conversation between Jesus and His disciple Peter just before Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane. After Jesus was betrayed by Judas, a group of soldiers moved in to arrest the Lord. In a rash attempt to protect Jesus, Peter pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear\u2014you can be sure Peter was trying to do more damage than that (John 18:10). Jesus rebuked Peter and put a quick stop to the bloodshed. Jesus replaced the wounded man\u2019s ear, healing him instantly (Luke 22:51). Then He told Peter to put his sword away, for \u201call who draw the sword will die by the sword\u201d (Matthew 26:52). Jesus also told Peter that He would not fight the arrest, for it was God\u2019s will that He drink the cup that was given to Him (John 18:11). Jesus had come to die as a sacrifice for sin, and now was the time. Jesus\u2019 placating of Peter also showed His concern for His disciple\u2014in warning Peter against using violence, Jesus prevented Peter from being arrested himself. \u201cLive by the sword, die by the sword\u201d has become a common expression, adapted from Jesus\u2019 words to Peter.

{"content": "\nDruids are followers of druidism, an ancient religion prevalent among the Celts before the arrival of Christianity. Classical druids were priests of sorts who specialized in the pursuit of wisdom through mystical means. They were teachers, philosophers, counselors, magicians, astrologers, and fortune-tellers. Modern druidism, or neo-druidry, is similar to the New Age movement in its lack of established doctrine. It is universalistic in its inclusiveness and acceptance of other belief systems and thus takes many different forms, from Druidcraft (a fusion of Wicca and druidism) to Christian Druidism with anything and everything in between. Druids can be monotheistic, duotheistic, polytheistic, animistic, pantheistic, etc., depending on what spiritual path the individual decides to pursue. Despite druidism\u2019s not having an official doctrine, there are a number of foundational elements that all druids subscribe to. First is the sacredness of all life. According to druidic philosophy, all life\u2014humans, plants, and animals\u2014is equal in value and importance in the interconnected web of life. Druids revere the earth, the human body, and the rest of the physical world as part of the spiritual Divine. Nature is seen as sacred, though how it directly corresponds to the Divine differs among druids. Some see nature as God, while others see nature as just a soothing balm to ease the stress of everyday life. There are many druids who wish to reconcile neo-druidry and Christianity as mutually beneficial; however, at their core these faiths are incompatible. While neo-druidry holds to the universalistic approach of all spiritual paths leading to God, Jesus preaches the opposite message in John 14:6: \u201cI am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through me.\u201d The Christian gospel is exclusive: the only way to God is through Jesus Christ. The second issue to consider in neo-druidry is their regard for all life as equal. While we have been given responsibility to care for our planet (Genesis 1:28), as creatures made in God\u2019s image, we have been placed in a position of authority over the earth and all that is in it (Genesis 1:26\u201328; Psalm 8:6\u20138). Additionally, while mankind has been created with an immortal soul (Genesis 2:7), the rest of creation is destined to fade away (Matthew 24:35). Third, Proverbs 9:10 tells us, \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.\u201d James 3:15 refers to a different brand of wisdom that is \u201cearthly, natural and demonic.\u201d Druids have a deep desire to acquire wisdom, but, instead of turning to the God of true wisdom, druids turn to mystical practices such as divination and shamanism for enlightenment. Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly condemns all manner of sorcery, including divination and communing with spirits (2 Chronicles 33:6; Leviticus 18:21; 20:2; Isaiah 57:5). In the New Testament, Paul encounters a slave girl with the power of divination (Acts 16:16); however, verse 18 shows her power came not from a good and holy source, but from a demon. On the surface, there are many aspects of neo-druidry that seem wholesome and in harmony with Christianity. We are to be good stewards of the earth, we are to pursue wisdom, we are to embrace a loving attitude toward our fellow man, and we should utilize our God-given creativity for His glory. However, upon deeper examination, neo-druidry covers up salvation-issue truths in pretty wrapping paper. First Peter 5:8 says, \u201cBe of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour,\u201d and 2 Corinthians 11:14 warns us that \u201cSatan disguises himself as an angel of light.\u201d No matter how nice something looks on the outside, it is critical to examine each detail in light of Scripture.

{"content": "nPsalm 19:14 states, \"May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.\" What, then, is Christian meditation, and how should Christians meditate? Unfortunately, the word \"meditation\" can carry the connotation of something mystical. For some, meditation is clearing the mind while sitting in an unusual position. For others, meditation is communing with the spirit world around us. Concepts such as these most definitely do not characterize Christian meditation.Christian meditation has nothing to do with practices that have Eastern mysticism as their foundation. Such practices include lectio divina, transcendental meditation, and many forms of what is called contemplative prayer. These have at their core a dangerous premise that we need to \"hear God's voice,\" not through His Word, but through personal revelation through meditation. Some churches are filled with people who think they are hearing a \"word from the Lord,\" often contradicting one another and therefore causing endless divisions within the body of Christ. Christians are not to abandon God's Word, which is \"God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work\" (2 Timothy 3:16-17). If the Bible is sufficient to thoroughly equip us for every good work, how could we think we need to seek a mystical experience instead of or in addition to it?Christian meditation is to be solely on the Word of God and what it reveals about Him. David found this to be so, and he describes the man who is \"blessed\" as one whose \"delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night\" (Psalm 1:2). True Christian meditation is an active thought process whereby we give ourselves to the study of the Word, praying over it and asking God to give us understanding by the Spirit, who has promised to lead us \"into all truth\" (John 16:13). Then we put this truth into practice, committing ourselves to the Scriptures as the rule for life and practice as we go about our daily activities. This causes spiritual growth and maturing in the things of God as we are taught by His Holy Spirit.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}],

{"content": "\nBecause genetic engineering was unknown at the time that the Bible was written, it is difficult to establish definitive references on that topic alone. In order to determine the Christian view of genetic engineering, we need to establish a grid of principles through which to view genetic engineering. For specifics on the Christian view of cloning, please see \u201cWhat is the Christian view of cloning?\u201d The element of greatest concern with genetic engineering involves how much liberty mankind can take in its responsibility to care for the human body and the rest of creation. There is no doubt that the Bible exhorts us to be responsible for our physical health. Proverbs refers to certain activities regarding restoring the health of an individual (Proverbs 12:18). The apostle Paul states that we have a certain duty to care for the body (Ephesians 5:29). He also encouraged his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Timothy, to take medicinal action for his infirmities (1 Timothy 5:23). Believers have the responsibility to use the body properly in that it is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19,20). We show our faith by offering assistance to those who have physical needs (James 2:16). Therefore, as Christians we should be concerned about the physical well-being of ourselves and others. Creation was to be under the care of humans (Genesis 1:28; 2:15-20), but the Bible tells us that creation was impacted by our sin (Genesis 3:17-19, Romans 8:19-21) and anticipates being redeemed from sin\u2019s effects. It is possible to conclude that, as caretakers of creation, humans have an obligation to \u201cfix\u201d the effects of the sin curse and attempt to bring things into a better alignment, using any means possible. Therefore, the thinking goes, any scientific advance can be used for the betterment of the creation. However, there are concerns regarding the use of genetic engineering to accomplish this good. 1. There is a concern that genetic engineering will take on a role beyond that which God has given to us as stewards of His creation. The Bible states that all things were created by God and for Him (Colossians 1:16). God designed all living things to reproduce after certain \u201ckinds\u201d (Genesis 1:11-25). Too much manipulation of the genetics (altering species) could be tampering with things reserved for the Designer. 2. There is a concern of genetic engineering attempting to preclude God\u2019s plan for the restoration of creation. As already stated, the creation was affected by the events recorded in Genesis 3 (mankind\u2019s rebellion against God\u2019s plan). Death entered into the world, and man\u2019s genetic make-up and that of the rest of creation began a change toward demise. In some instances, genetic engineering could be seen as an attempt to undo this result of sin called the \u201ccurse.\u201d God has said that He has a remedy for this\u2014redemption through Jesus Christ, as described in Romans 8 and 1 Corinthians 15. The creation anticipates newness associated with the culmination of God\u2019s promise to restore things to an even better state than the original. To go \u201ctoo far\u201d to fight this process may compete with the responsibility of individuals to trust in Christ for restoration (Philippians 3:21). 3. There is a concern that genetic engineering may interfere with the God-ordained process of life. It seems evident from a general study of Scripture that God has a plan for the process of life. For example, Psalm 139 describes an intimate relationship between the psalmist and his Creator from the womb. Would the use of genetic manipulation to create life outside of God\u2019s plan jeopardize the development of a God-conscious soul? Would interfering with the process of physical life affect the prospects of spiritual life? Romans 5:12 tells us that all humanity sins because Adam sinned. It is understood that this involved the transference of the sin nature from generation to generation so that all have sinned (Romans 3:23). Paul explains the hope of eternity through the conquering of Adam\u2019s sin. If all that are in Adam (from his seed) die, and Christ died for those in such condition, could life created outside of that \u201cseed\u201d be redeemed? (1 Corinthians 15:22, 23).  4. There is a concern that a bold pursuit of advances in genetic engineering is motivated by a defiance of God. Genesis 11:1-9 shows what happens when the creation attempts to exalt itself above the Creator. The people in Genesis 11 were unified, yet they were not submissive to God. As a result, God stopped their progress. God certainly recognized that there were some dangers involved with the direction in which the people were headed. We have a similar warning in Romans 1:18-32. There God describes individuals that have become so enamored with the creation (actually worshipping it instead of the Creator) that they were brought to destruction. The fear is that genetic engineering could foster similar motivations, and ultimately, similar results. These are questions and issues for which we have no answers at present, but they are concerns, and they should be carefully considered by Christians attempting to adopt a view of genetic engineering.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["spiritual_condition"], "points": [{"start": 5061, "end": 5069, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 5061, "end": 5066, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4658, "end": 4660, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4492, "end": 4494, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4464, "end": 4466, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4446, "end": 4448, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4274, "end": 4276, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4043, "end": 4048, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 4013, "end": 4016, "text": "Adam"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 3982, "end": 3991, "text": "Adam\u2019s sin"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3982, "end": 3985, "text": "Adam"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3921, "end": 3924, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 3768, "end": 3771, "text": "Adam"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3604, "end": 3606, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3561, "end": 3563, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3347, "end": 3349, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3261, "end": 3263, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 3148, "end": 3153, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2972, "end": 2974, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2849, "end": 2854, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2843, "end": 2854, "text": "Jesus Christ"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2843, "end": 2847, "text": "Jesus"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2781, "end": 2783, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2535, "end": 2537, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2381, "end": 2383, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2113, "end": 2115, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2078, "end": 2080, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2033, "end": 2037, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1980, "end": 1982, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1359, "end": 1363, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_condition"], "points": [{"start": 1193, "end": 1201, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 1193, "end": 1198, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["holy_spirit"], "points": [{"start": 1054, "end": 1065, "text": "Holy Spirit "}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 948, "end": 954, "text": "Timothy"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 891, "end": 897, "text": "Timothy"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 780, "end": 783, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 772, "end": 783, "text": "apostle Paul"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 604, "end": 608, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_condition"], "points": [{"start": 374, "end": 382, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 374, "end": 379, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_condition"], "points": [{"start": 323, "end": 331, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 323, "end": 328, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_condition"], "points": [{"start": 178, "end": 186, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 178, "end": 183, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 61, "end": 65, "text": "Bible"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541292569000, "last_updated_at": 1541292569000, "sec_taken": 144, "last_updated_by": "xDPdj3DraCaPxIDu0WPn8X4MNDX2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "nThe most crucial problem with the Roman Catholic Church is its belief that faith alone in Christ is not sufficient for salvation. The Bible clearly and consistently states that receiving Jesus Christ as Savior, by grace through faith, grants salvation (John 1:12; 3:16,18,36; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10,13; Ephesians 2:8-9). The Roman Catholic Church rejects this. The official position of the Roman Catholic Church is that a person must believe in Jesus Christ AND be baptized AND receive the Eucharist along with the other sacraments AND obey the decrees of the Roman Catholic Church AND perform meritorious works AND not die with any mortal sins AND etc., etc., etc. Catholic divergence from the Bible on this most crucial of issues, salvation, means that yes, Catholicism is a false religion. If a person believes what the Catholic Church officially teaches, he/she will not be saved. Any claim that works or rituals must be added to faith in order for salvation to be achieved is a claim that Jesus' death was not sufficient to fully purchase our salvation.While salvation by faith is the most crucial issue, in comparing Roman Catholicism with the Word of God, there are many other differences and contradictions as well. The Roman Catholic Church teaches many doctrines that are in disagreement with what the Bible declares. These include apostolic succession, worship of saints or Mary, prayer to saints or Mary, the pope / papacy, infant baptism, transubstantiation, plenary indulgences, the sacramental system, and purgatory. While Catholics claim Scriptural support for these concepts, none of these teachings have any solid foundation in the clear teaching of Scripture. These concepts are based on Catholic tradition, not the Word of God. In fact, they all clearly contradict Biblical principles.In regards to the question \"Are Catholics saved?\", this is a more difficult question to answer. It is impossible to give a universal statement on the salvation of all members of any denomination of Christianity. Not ALL Baptists are saved. Not ALL Presbyterians are saved. Not ALL Lutherans are saved. Salvation is determined by personal faith in Jesus alone for salvation, not by titles or denominational identification. Despite the unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, there are genuine believers who attend Roman Catholic churches. There are many Roman Catholics who have genuinely placed their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. However, these Catholic Christians are believers despite what the Catholic Church teaches, not because of what it teaches. To varying degrees, the Catholic Church teaches from the Bible and points people to Jesus Christ as the Savior. As a result, people are sometimes saved in Catholic churches. The Bible has an impact whenever it is proclaimed (Isaiah 55:11). Catholic Christians remain in the Catholic Church out of ignorance of what the Catholic Church truly stands for, out of family tradition and peer pressure, or out of a desire to reach other Catholics for Christ.At the same time, the Catholic Church also leads many people away from a genuine faith relationship with Christ. The unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church have often given the enemies of Christ opportunity to blaspheme. The Roman Catholic Church is not the church that Jesus Christ established. It is not a church that is based on the teachings of the Apostles (as described in the Book of Acts and the New Testament epistles). While Jesus' words in Mark 7:9 were directed towards the Pharisees, they accurately describe the Roman Catholic Church, \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!\"", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3621,

{"content": "n\nThe Bible does not record anyone being baptized by Jesus. John 4:1\u20132 records, \u201cNow Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John\u2014although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples\u201d (emphasis added). This does not necessarily mean that Jesus never baptized anyone Himself. But during the specific timeframe surrounding John 4:1\u20132, Jesus did not baptize. Opening the possibility that Jesus did baptize is Matthew 3:14, in which John the Baptist says to Jesus, \u201cI need to be baptized by you.\u201d Also, in Matthew 3:11 John the Baptist, speaking about Jesus, declares, \u201cI baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.\u201d But neither of these verses is conclusive about whether or not Jesus baptized. Matthew 3:11 is not referring to water baptism. Neither Matthew 3:11 or 3:14 specifically say that Jesus Himself baptized anyone. The question of whether Jesus baptized anyone cannot be definitively answered. Based on John 4:1\u20132, it seems unlikely that Jesus Himself baptized. Why would Jesus not personally baptize anyone? The Bible does not say. A plausible explanation for why Jesus may not have baptized anyone is that Jesus did not want anyone thinking themselves superior to other believers based on who had baptized them. Someone baptized by Jesus would be tempted to broadcast the fact and feel a little smug around those who were only baptized by, say, Thomas or Thaddaeus. Such proud sectarianism is human nature.

{"content": "\nThe Assemblies of God is one of the largest Pentecostal denominations, with 57 million adherents worldwide. It was organized in 1914 to promote unity and doctrinal stability among groups that had been influenced by the Pentecostal revivals of the early 1900s, revivals which were the result of a desire to see an increase in God's power in churches and individuals. Many people spent long hours in prayer, seeking a fresh infusion of the Spirit. Following the teachings of Charles Parham, these people were expecting speaking in tongues as an evidence of the Holy Spirit's baptism. The first popularly acknowledged revival was at Azusa Street in Los Angeles, 1906-1909. From that movement, several churches were formed, and in April 1914, meetings were held in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which led to the formation of the Assemblies of God. Eudorus Bell, formerly a Southern Baptist preacher, was appointed as the first chairman of the denomination. The core doctrines of the Assemblies of God are salvation by repentance and faith, Holy Spirit baptism as evidenced by speaking in tongues, divine healing as an expected part of salvation, and the imminent Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Like many other Pentecostal churches, their doctrine of salvation follows the teachings of Jacob Arminius (1560-1609) in that believers can fall from grace as a result of persistent, unrepentant sin. The need for personal repentance and faith in Jesus' substitutionary death for sin is the cornerstone of salvation (Luke 24:46-47). Regarding the baptism of the Spirit, the official emphasis of the church is on the need for power from on high to witness, not on an experience or bubbly feelings. Even though this is the official statement of the church, it is easily observed that some Assemblies of God preachers have given an inordinate focus on the ecstatic experiences like being slain in the Spirit and \u201choly laughter\u201d. On the doctrine of divine healing, again there is a discrepancy between the official position and that of some teachers. The Assemblies of God website states that the same faith that saves also heals and that preachers don't heal \u2013 only God does. Believers are called to pray and leave the outcome to God. Yet some of the more infamous faith healers who have been ordained in the Assemblies of God portray themselves as special avenues of God's healing. The emphasis of the Assemblies of God churches has always been evangelism and missions, and faith healing crusades have often been a key element of that work. While many people have evidently been brought to saving faith through the faithful work of Assemblies of God churches, there have also been a significant number of problems associated with their ministries. Benny Hinn, Morris Cerullo, Jim Bakker, and Jimmy Swaggart all received their ministry credentials through the Assemblies of God and have been repeatedly involved in scandals. The Toronto blessing (laughing revival) and Brownsville (Pensacola) Revival were both led by Assemblies of God churches and have led to a wide range of biblically questionable practices. Even though revival and healing campaigns have been a hallmark of Assemblies of God ministries for years, there is little evidence to show that God was at work in those campaigns. In the cities where many thousands supposedly came to Christ, there has been no noticeable decrease in crime or divorce, and even though hundreds have claimed healing, there are no documented cases of visibly evident healing (like restored limbs or reversed diseases).There are many deeply committed believers within the Assemblies of God, and we ought to love them as brothers and sisters in Christ. Within that fellowship are also many people who have been confused by the emphasis on healing and signs and the false doctrines taught by a few noteworthy teachers. Any time we give preeminence to emotional experience over the clear teaching of the Word, we open the door to potentially harmful doctrines. First Thessalonians 5:21 commands us to \u201cprove all things; hold fast that which is good.\u201d As believers, we ought to carefully examine every teaching and practice, compare it to the Word of God, and hold on to only those things which are upright by that standard.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label":

{"content": "n\nThe motto \u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d is considered one of the classical definitions of theology. The statement is originally translated from the Latin fides quaerens intellectum. \u201cFaith seeking understanding\u201d means that faith in God revealed in Jesus Christ prompts a questioning search for deeper understanding. The exact phrase \u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d was introduced by Anselm of Canterbury (1033\u20131109), a monk, theologian, and Archbishop of Canterbury, in his book Proslogium. Before Anselm, Augustine of Hippo (AD 354\u2013430) coined a similar Latin phrase: Crede ut intelligas, or \u201cbelieve that you may understand.\u201d Augustine believed that knowledge of God comes before faith in Him, but faith in God brings with it a constant desire for deeper understanding. To phrase it simply, Christians earnestly want to understand what they believe. Anselm agreed with Augustine. He believed that faith is required for understanding, but also that reason is essential to understanding. To Anselm, Christian faith sets in motion a quest to know and understand God and what we believe about Him. Faith, according to Anselm, causes believers to seek understanding for the joy of knowing God and loving Him. In his book Faith Seeking Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Theology, Daniel L. Migliore explains, \u201cFor Anselm, faith seeks understanding, and understanding brings joy.\u201d Anselm himself wrote in Proslogium, \u201cI pray thee, O God, let me know thee and love thee so that I may rejoice in thee.\u201d The Bible promotes the idea of faith seeking understanding. Jesus taught that the greatest commandment adjures us to love the Lord with all our minds (Matthew 22:37). Speaking to the disciples in one of His post-resurrection appearances, Jesus \u201copened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures\u201d (Luke 24:45). Faith is what overcomes the world (1 John 5:4), but that faith is accompanied by an understanding of God: \u201cWe know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true\u201d (verse 20). In a discussion of Anselm\u2019s motto, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy clears up two misconceptions. Many have mistaken \u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d to mean that Anselm hoped to replace faith with understanding, but this is far from true. Faith for Anselm is an active love for God in pursuit of deeper knowledge of God. Second, many philosophers have thought \u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d pertains only to believers because it begins with faith. But Anselm believed that reason alone was enough to convince even a moderately intelligent person of God\u2019s existence. Anslem\u2019s book Monologion begins with these words: \u201cIf anyone does not know, either because he has not heard or because he does not believe, that there is one nature, supreme among all existing things, who alone is self-sufficient in his eternal happiness, who through his omnipotent goodness grants and brings it about that all other things exist or have any sort of well-being, and a great many other things that we must believe about God or his creation, I think he could at least convince himself of most of these things by reason alone, if he is even moderately intelligent.\u201d Anselm\u2019s motto of \u201cfaith seeking understanding\u201d formed the foundation of the medieval theological and philosophical system known as Scholasticism, which sought to unite faith and reason into one coherent system.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["theological_question"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points":

{"content": "\n\u201cReprobation\u201d is the term used to describe those who by default are left in their fallen human nature to sin and to be eternally damned. It can be the only possible consequence if, as Scripture declares, God has foreknown and chosen others to eternal life through His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:4-5; Romans 9:24-25). In Acts 13:48, we read, \u201cAnd all who were appointed for eternal life believed.\u201d From this, we see that the decree of reprobation is a result of unbelief or, rather, the decree of reprobation results in unbelief. Some theologians declare from Scripture that God foreknew some and reprobated others, prior to the Fall of Adam. This is called supralapsarianism, from the Latin\u00a0supra meaning \u201cabove\u201d and lapsus, meaning \u201cfall.\u201d Others maintain that foreknowledge and reprobation were decreed to happen as a consequence of the Fall, and this is termed \u201cinfralapsarianism.\u201d The existence of the state of reprobation can be deduced from the Scriptures in many places, such as Proverbs 16:4 and Jeremiah 6:30, just to name two. Although it describes the fact that God has rejected some, there is a sense in which those whom He has rejected still serve His purposes, despite their willful rebellion. The best example is the raising up of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus. Here was a man who clearly refused to obey God, despite Moses\u2019 repeated petitions to let the Israelites leave the land of Egypt. But the thing we note about Pharaoh is that, despite his willful obstinacy, God was nevertheless glorified through him. Reading Exodus 9:13-16, we note that God says He could have wiped the whole of Egypt and Pharaoh out of existence were it not for His wish to demonstrate His power and make His name known throughout the earth (Exodus 14:4,31). Clearly, God will fulfill all of His eternal purposes, both through those whom He has foreknown (Philippians 2:13) and through those whom He has rejected\u2014the reprobate (Romans 9:22). In both cases, God will receive the highest honor and glory. Finally, the question that remains is whether we can declare anyone to be reprobate in this life. Clearly, we cannot. The doctrines of grace as purported by John Calvin are both the hub and very essence of reformed theology, but sadly some have taken them to the extreme. Hypercalvinism, for example, dares to declare that the taking of the gospel to the world is unnecessary if God has already decreed those He would or wouldn\u2019t save. However, John 3:16 would not say \u201cFor God so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life\u201d if, indeed, we were privy to such secret things as those who are reprobate. Our responsibility is to preach the gospel to all men everywhere, pleading with them to be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:20).", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent",

{"content": "n\nAccording to the 4th-century bishop Epiphanius, Titus Flavius Clemens was born into a pagan family in Athens. Clemens is today called Clement of Alexandria (c. AD 155\u2013c. 220)\u2014his city of residence is added to distinguish him from the earlier Clement of Rome. As a seeker of truth, Clement traveled through Greece, Italy, Syria, Palestine, and finally to Alexandria, Egypt. Alexandria was a melting pot of all sorts of religious and philosophical ideas. There he encountered the teacher of the Alexandria Catechetical School, Pantaenus, who presented him with the Christian message; Clement became a believer. In time, Clement would succeed Pantaenus as head of the school in Alexandria. Clement\u2019s approach was tailored to reach the educated intelligentsia and those steeped in Greek culture. He believed that, just as the Mosaic Law provided background to prepare Jews to come to Christ, so pagan philosophy provided the background that could prepare the pagan for faith in Christ. He presented Christianity as a new philosophy in terminology that would appeal to Gnostics. At a time when Gnostic teaching was becoming ever more popular, Clement taught that faith was the basis of true knowledge (or gnosis). It was during his time at the school (190\u2013202) that Clement did most of his writing. He wrote Exhortations (often called Exhortations to Greeks, Exhortations to the Heathen, or Exhortations to Gentiles) using extensive philosophical quotations and sophisticated argumentation to show pagan unbelievers that Christianity was reasonable. In his work to Christians, Instructor, he covered many areas of Christian behavior as taught by the Instructor (the Logos) and stressed moderation. In Miscellanies Clement explains that one must sift through a lot of beliefs to come to the truth. Christianity, according to Clement of Alexandria, is complete in itself\u2014the true gnosis\u2014but philosophy is a useful tool to arrive at the truth. One sermon, many letters, and fragments of a few other works of Clement survive. The sermon, Who Is the Rich Man That Shall Be Saved?, is significant in that it addresses a problem that Christians did not have to often face in the early years of the church\u2014what is the responsibility of rich Christians?

{"content": "n\nThe Age of Grace, also called the Dispensation of Grace or the Church Age, is the sixth divinely apportioned dispensation of world history, according to dispensationalism. Dispensationalism is a system theologians use to divide and categorize historical events in the Bible. Most agree that there are seven dispensations, though some believe there are nine or three. The Age of Grace is the dispensation that is occurring right now in history. It began with the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2) and is made possible by Jesus\u2019 sacrificial death on the cross, His resurrection, and His ascension: \u201cThe grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people\u201d (Titus 2:11). Salvation has always been by the grace of God, received by faith (Genesis 15:6). In the Dispensation of Law, God required His people to follow the Law of Moses and offer sacrifices for their sin\u2014sacrifices that pointed forward to the gracious provision of the Lamb of God (John 1:29). \u201cThe law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ\u201d (John 1:17). Now, during the Age of Grace, \u201cwe are not under the law but under grace\u201d (Romans 6:15). The Law has been fulfilled (Matthew 5:17), and God\u2019s grace in Christ is plain for all to see. All that is required for salvation is to trust in Jesus Christ (Acts 16:31). He has done all that is necessary for salvation (Ephesians 2:8\u20139). The term \u201cAge of Grace\u201d could be misleading to some\u2014it is not meant to imply that the people in the Old Testament, before Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection, were denied God\u2019s grace. They still had to trust in the Lord\u2014a trust they showed in offering the sacrifices. The Old Testament worshiper, by sacrificing an animal, was saying, \u201cI trust God will save me despite the fact that I am sinful.\u201d Christians take the same approach today, spiritually, but the practice is different. Instead of offering repeated sacrifices for sins, we trust in the one-time sacrifice of Christ (Hebrews 10:1\u201310). The grace of God has been available throughout all the dispensations (Psalm 116:5). In this present day, this Age of Grace, our Lord has commanded the gospel to be taken to every corner of the globe, because He \u201cwants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth\u201d (1 Timothy 2:4; cf. 2 Peter 3:9).

{"content": "n\nThe Invisible Pink Unicorn argument states that since the existence of an invisible pink unicorn cannot be disproven, it is just as valid to believe in an invisible pink unicorn as it is to believe in God. This argument is offered by atheists in an attempt to show that belief in God is both self-contradictory and irrational. Supposedly, the fact that the Invisible Pink Unicorn is defined in conflicting and unfalsifiable terms means that God, whom the atheist is targeting, is no more believable than the Invisible Pink Unicorn. Just as the Flying Spaghetti Monsterism isn\u2019t actually a meaningful argument against religious belief, Christianity in particular, the Invisible Pink Unicorn is an attempt to avoid discussion by mocking a superficial shadow of faith. For instance, the contradiction of the unicorn\u2019s being both \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cpink\u201d is meant to satirize the supposedly paradoxical attributes of God. But this criticism is contrary to established history. Theologians have spent considerable time demonstrating the logical consistency of God. But, of course, that kind of in-depth thinking is precisely what the Invisible Pink Unicorn argument is meant to avoid. Like internet memes or ridicule, the Invisible Pink Unicorn argument is meant to short-circuit understanding by appealing to a shallow, caricatured version of what\u2019s being criticized. The biggest weakness in the Invisible Pink Unicorn argument is that it presumes that belief in God is entirely grounded in the claim that God cannot be disproved. Since the unicorn cannot be disproved by any means, so the argument goes, there is just as much reason to believe in it as there is to believe in God. Again, this argument is an example of an incomplete understanding of Christian theology, missing as it does a major philosophical and historical aspect of Christian thought: the idea that there are positive reasons suggesting the existence of God. The Invisible Pink Unicorn argument is wrong to associate faith with an inability to disprove something. Major historical cases for the existence of God, such as the cosmological, teleological, and ontological arguments, don\u2019t make claims based on an inability to disprove. Rather, they claim to provide positive, logical evidence of a deity. And they are supported and inspired by actual observations. Belief in Judeo-Christianity, especially, is bolstered by positive evidence. According to the Bible, general human experience (Romans 1:18\u201322), science and nature (Psalm 19:1), eyewitness testimony (2 Peter 1:16), written Scripture (John 5:39), correspondence (Acts 17:11), and objective evidence (Luke 1:1\u20134) all combine to point to the existence of a particular deity: the God of the Bible. No atheist is expected, let alone obligated, to accept any of that reasoning, of course. If the Invisible Pink Unicorn is a pointless and powerless attack on the Christian God\u2014and it is\u2014such a fact does not mean that God exists by default. However, there is a profound difference between informed dissent and ignorant caricature. The Invisible Pink Unicorn, as a thought exercise, is just a modern version of Russell\u2019s Teapot. As such, it only demonstrates the weakness of any proposition that has no defense other than being unfalsifiable.

{"content": "\nThe events that happened on the road to Damascus relate not only to the apostle Paul, whose dramatic conversion occurred there, but they also provide a clear picture of the conversion of all people. While some have an extraordinarily dramatic conversion known as a \u201cDamascus Road experience,\u201d the conversion of all believers follows a similar pattern of Paul\u2019s experience on the road to Damascus, described in Paul\u2019s own words in Acts 9:1\u20139; Acts 22:6\u201311; and Acts 26:9\u201320. Putting the three accounts together, the details of this amazing experience come together. Paul, who went by the name of Saul at that time, was on his way to Damascus with a letter from the high priest of the temple in Jerusalem giving him authority to arrest any who belonged to \u201cthe Way,\u201d meaning those who followed Christ. So intent was he on \u201copposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d (Acts 26:9) that in \u201craging fury,\u201d he breathed \u201cthreats and murder against the disciples of the Lord.\u201d Here was a man who truly hated Christ and all who were associated with Him. Suddenly a bright light shone on Saul, causing his entire party to fall to the ground. Then Jesus spoke to Saul, asking him, \u201cWhy are you persecuting me?\u201d in a voice understood only by him. Saul recognized that this was a deity of some sort because he called Him \u201cLord\u201d and asked who He was. When Jesus identified Himself as the very One Saul had been persecuting, one can only imagine the terror that filled Saul\u2019s heart. Saul was speechless, no doubt thinking to himself, \u201cI\u2019m a dead man.\u201d The Acts 22 version of the story indicates that Saul\u2019s response was to ask what Jesus wanted him to do. The Acts 9 and Acts 22 retellings of the story have Saul saying Jesus told him to rise and go to Damascus where he would be told what to do. In the Acts 26 story, which is longer and more detailed, Saul describes Jesus\u2019 commission of him as His messenger to the Gentiles (which must have amazed Saul, the ultimate Gentile-hating Pharisee), to turn many from darkness to the light and from the power of Satan to God. His message of forgiveness of sins and \u201ca place among those who are sanctified by faith\u201d must have also astonished Saul because the Jews were convinced they alone had the place of honor in God\u2019s eyes. There is no discrepancy or contradiction among these three accounts. Even though Saul received his commission from Jesus on the road, he still had to go into Damascus and be told what to do\u2014meet with Ananias who laid hands on him, receive the Holy Spirit, be baptized, and be received by the disciples there (Acts 9:15\u201316, 19; 22:12\u201316). At Damascus, he also went for three days without eating or drinking, and then received his sight, which had been taken from him on the road. The phrase \u201cDamascus Road experience\u201d is used to describe a conversion which is dramatic and startling. Many people receive Christ in a life-changing, instantaneous experience, although many others describe their conversion as more of a gradual understanding of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. But both types of experiences have several things in common. First, salvation is of the Lord, by His will and according to His plan and purpose (Acts 22:14). As He does one way or another to each of us, Jesus made it clear to Saul that he had gone his own way for long enough. Now he was to become an instrument in the hands of the Master to do His will as He had foreordained it. Second, the response of both Saul and all those who are redeemed by Christ is the same: \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d Like Saul, we do not bargain, negotiate, question, or come halfway. The response of the redeemed is obedience. When God truly touches our hearts, our only response can be, \u201cLord, may your will be done and may you use me to do it.\u201d Such was the experience of Saul on the Damascus Road. Saul\u2019s dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus was the beginning of an incredible journey. And while not all conversions are as startling as Saul\u2019s, each of us is commissioned by Jesus to live in obedience to Him (John 14:15), love one another in His name (1 John 2:23), \u201cknow Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,\u201d (Philippians 3:10), and tell the world of the wonderful riches in Christ.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 4288, "end": 4293, "text": "Christ"}]},

{"content": "n\nThe Moravian Church considers itself to be the oldest Protestant denomination and has its roots in the teaching of the Reformer John Hus. The Moravian Church was founded in 1457 in the Czech Republic by a small group of Hussites desiring more radical reform of the church. They established a community called the Unity of the Brethren (or, in Latin, Unitas Fratrum) in Kunwald. In 1467 they established a priesthood/episcopacy and divided into three branches: Moravian, Polish, and Bohemian. The Moravian Church has long been associated with cross-cultural missionary activity. In the 1720s Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf of Germany accepted Moravian refugees onto his estate. They signed a Brotherly Agreement and formed a community called Herrnhut (\u201cThe Lord\u2019s Watch\u201d), which was led by Zinzendorf. In 1732 missionaries from Herrnhut went to St. Thomas Island. Missions efforts expanded to the rest of the Caribbean (largely to the African slave population there), Greenland, Labrador (to the Inuit people), Surinam, Guyana, South Africa, and North America (to the native tribes). The pioneering efforts of the Moravians in spreading the gospel were responsible for untold thousands of people coming to faith in Christ. It was through the testimony of the Moravians that John Wesley experienced conversion. Moravian missionaries came to the United States during the colonial period. The Moravians gained a permanent presence in Pennsylvania by 1741. The Moravian Church now has about one million members, mostly in eastern Africa, but also in the Caribbean basin; South Africa; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Moravians are sometimes known as \u201cGod\u2019s happy people.\u201d They stress the importance of community, commonly calling one another \u201cBrother\u201d or \u201cSister.\u201d Some early critics objected to Moravian settlements because the Moravians affirmed \u201cordinary\u201d people: they accepted members of all races, nationalities, and social classes; allowed women to hold positions of leadership; and emphasized the spiritual lives of children. The community of Herrnhut promoted the \u201ctheology of the heart,\u201d centering more on the believer\u2019s relationship with Christ than on doctrine. Moravians believe that faith is completed in love and that the ability to live in loving community is a sign of true faith. They attempt to avoid legalism while also striving to live ethically and in loving service to others. Church services are a blend between free church and liturgical, but music is central in Moravian life and worship. The Moravian Church practices infant baptism, which is seen as entry into a covenant of grace rather than a cleansing of original sin. Infants who are baptized undergo confirmation to become adult members of the church. However, membership in the church is not a requirement to partake in communion. Baptized children who have been prepared for communion by talking with a pastor and members of other Christian churches are all invited to partake. Communion in Moravian churches includes what is known as the Right Hand of Fellowship. Both before and after the consecration and partaking of the elements, congregants shake hands. The first handclasp is meant to show oneness in Christ and a desire to be at peace with one another. The second is for renewed dedication to service of Christ and signifies unity of purpose. In a similar vein, communion is viewed as a reminder of social responsibility\u2014receipt of Christ\u2019s love, forgiveness, and new life so that partakers may in turn proclaim the gospel and share God\u2019s gifts with others. Practically, Moravians understand themselves called to reach out to the poor, homeless, persecuted, and sick, inviting all to the feast of God\u2019s gifts, both visible and invisible. Moravians also celebrate lovefeasts, usually on church year holidays, congregational anniversary days, or the like. Moravians say that lovefeasts originated in the gatherings of the early church after Pentecost when believers broke bread together, often in tandem with the celebration of communion. The Moravian Church began the practice of holding lovefeasts in 1727 when, after a communion service, congregants were reluctant to return home; so Count Zinzendorf provided food so they could remain and participate in religious conversation, prayer, and singing. Lovefeast services today are mainly song services. Food is distributed to the congregation, usually a sweet bun and coffee or lemonade. The only requirements for the food being distributed are that it be simple and easy to hand out. Often, lovefeast services attract many visitors. The Moravian Church worldwide (called the Unitas Fratrum or the Unity) is divided into provinces governed by Provincial Synods. Individual congregations send delegates to the synod, which meets once every three to four years. The synods elect members of the Provincial Elders Conference. Local congregations are governed by a Board of Elders, which is elected by the membership. Pastors are accountable to the Board of Elders and the Provincial Elders Conference. Leadership offices also include deacon, presbyter (essentially a senior deacon), and bishop (elected from among the presbyters by the synods and ordained). Bishops serve the Moravian Church worldwide rather than a particular province. They do not hold any administrative authority but function as a pastor to the pastors. The Moravian Church views itself as Christocentric with a special emphasis on community and love.

{"content": "n\nReligion is \u201cthe belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.\u201d In that respect, Christianity can be classified as a religion. However, practically speaking, Christianity has a key difference that separates it from other belief systems that are considered religions. That difference is relationship. Most religion, theistic or otherwise, is man-centered. Any relationship with God is based on man\u2019s works. A theistic religion, such as Judaism or Islam, holds to the belief in a supreme God or gods; while non-theistic religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, focus on metaphysical thought patterns and spiritual \u201cenergies.\u201d But most religions are similar in that they are built upon the concept that man can reach a higher power or state of being through his own efforts. In most religions, man is the aggressor and the deity is the beneficiary of man\u2019s efforts, sacrifices, or good deeds. Paradise, nirvana, or some higher state of being is man\u2019s reward for his strict adherence to whatever tenets that religion prescribes. In that regard, Christianity is not a religion; it is a relationship that God has established with His children. In Christianity, God is the aggressor and man is the beneficiary (Romans 8:3). The Bible states clearly that there is nothing man can do to make himself right with God (Isaiah 53:6; 64:6; Romans 3:23; 6:23). According to Christianity, God did for us what we cannot do for ourselves (Colossians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Our sin separates us from His presence, and sin must be punished (Romans 6:23; Matthew 10:28; 23:33). But, because God loves us, He took our punishment upon Himself. All we must do is accept God\u2019s gift of salvation through faith (Ephesians 2:8\u20139; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Grace is God\u2019s blessing on the undeserving. The grace-based relationship between God and man is the foundation of Christianity and the antithesis of religion. Established religion was one of the staunchest opponents of Jesus during His earthly ministry. When God gave His Law to the Israelites, His desire was that they \u201clove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength\u201d (Deuteronomy 6:5; Matthew 22:37). \u201cLove\u201d speaks of relationship. Obedience to all the other commands had to stem from a love for God. We are able to love Him \u201cbecause He first loved us\u201d (1 John 4:19). However, by Jesus\u2019 time, the Jewish leaders had made a religion out of God\u2019s desire to live in a love relationship with them (1 Timothy 1:8; Romans 7:12). Over the years, they had perverted God\u2019s Law into a works-based religion that alienated people from Him (Matthew 23:13\u201315; Luke 11:42). Then they added many of their own rules to make it even more cumbersome (Isaiah 29:13; Matthew 15:9). They prided themselves on their ability to keep the Law\u2014at least outwardly\u2014and lorded their authority over the common people who could never keep such strenuous rules. The Pharisees, as adept as they were at rule-keeping, failed to recognize God Himself when He was standing right in front of them (John 8:19). They had chosen religion over relationship. Just as the Jewish leaders made a religion out of a relationship with God, many people do the same with Christianity. Entire denominations have followed the way of the Pharisees in creating rules not found in Scripture. Some who profess to follow Christ are actually following man-made religion in the name of Jesus. While claiming to believe Scripture, they are often plagued with fear and doubt that they may not be good enough to earn salvation or that God will not accept them if they don\u2019t perform to a certain standard. This is religion masquerading as Christianity, and it is one of Satan\u2019s favorite tricks. Jesus addressed this in Matthew 23:1\u20137 when He rebuked the Pharisees. Instead of pointing people to heaven, these religious leaders were keeping people out of the kingdom of God. Holiness and obedience to Scripture are important, but they are evidences of a transformed heart, not a means to attain it. God desires that we be holy as He is holy (1 Peter 1:16). He wants us to grow in grace and knowledge of Him (2 Peter 3:18). But we do these things because we are His children and want to be like Him, not in order to earn His love. Christianity is not about signing up for a religion. Christianity is about being born into the family of God (John 3:3). It is a relationship. Just as an adopted child has no power to create an adoption, we have no power to join the family of God by our own efforts. We can only accept His invitation to know Him as Father through adoption (Ephesians 1:5; Romans 8:15). When we join His family through faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus, the Holy Spirit comes to live inside our hearts (1 Corinthians 6:19; Luke 11:13; 2 Corinthians 1:21\u201322). He then empowers us to live like children of the King. He does not ask us to try to attain holiness by our own strength, as religion does. He asks that our old self be crucified with Him so that His power can live through us (Galatians 2:20; Romans 6:6). God wants us to know Him, to draw near to Him, to pray to Him, and love Him above everything. That is not religion; that is a relationship.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points":

{"content": "\nIntroduction to Bible StudyAs a Muslim, you want to know Allah, but do you know Isa\u2014Jesus Christ\u2014Whom God sent? \u201cAnd this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent\u201d (John 17:3). In this one-week Bible study, we\u2019ll study the life of Jesus, primarily through the Gospel of Luke. Begin seeking eternal life today!Day 1: Jesus the Perfect ManJesus is different from any other man. Not once during His earthly life did He sin against God or man. Ever since Adam and Eve disobeyed God, every other human has been born a sinner. Although Jesus was fully human, He didn\u2019t inherit Adam\u2019s sin nature and guilt because Jesus was born of a virgin by the power of God. Not even the devil\u2019s direct temptation could cause Jesus to sin. Jesus Himself said, \u201cWhich one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?\u201d (John 8:46). Read the Word of God and believe that Jesus is the only perfect Man. Virgin-born \u201cIn the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, \u2018Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!\u2019\u201cBut she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, \u2018Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\u2019\u201cAnd Mary said to the angel, \u2018How will this be, since I am a virgin?\u2019\u201cAnd the angel answered her, \u2018The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy\u2014the Son of God\u2019\u201d (Luke 1:26-35).Without an earthly father, Jesus was called God\u2019s Son\u2014not to imply parenthood between God and Mary but the special relationship between God and Jesus Christ. Jesus was sent from God. Overcoming the devil\u2019s temptation\u201cAnd Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry.\u201cThe devil said to him, \u2018If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.\u2019 And Jesus answered him, \u2018It is written, \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.\"\u2019\u201cAnd the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, \u2018To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.\u2019 And Jesus answered him, \u2018It is written, \u201cYou shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.\"\u2019\u201cAnd he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, \u2018If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written, \u201cHe will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,\u201d and \"On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.\"\u2019 And Jesus answered him, \u2018It is said, \u201cYou shall not put the Lord your God to the test.\"\u2019\u201cAnd when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.\u201cAnd Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all\u201d (Luke 4:1-15).Sinless\u201cHe committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth\u201d (1 Peter 2:22).With His virgin birth and sinless life, Jesus is unique among men. No wonder the angel told Mary that Jesus would \u201cbe called holy\u2014the Son of God\u201d (Luke 1:35c).

{"content": "nJesus died on the cross to bear sin\u2019s punishment for believers. Many people have doubted Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and resurrection from the grave, despite historical evidence. Muslims question, \u201cWhy would Allah require His prophet Isa to die?\u201dThe Scripture explains that Jesus Christ died for our sins: \u201cChrist died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:3b-4). Scripture affirms that the sinless Jesus bled and died on the cross to pay the punishment for believing sinners. Let\u2019s study the Scriptures, the Bible, to find out why Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection provide the only entrance for sinners into paradise. The punishment for sin is deathThe Bible says the holy God created earth and man perfectly. But Adam and Eve fell to the temptation of Satan and disobeyed God. Ever since Adam\u2019s sin, sin has infected the human race. Each person is guilty: \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 3:23). Sin is not just big things like murder or blasphemy but also includes lying, lusting, and stealing. Even the love of money or hatred of enemies is sin, according to the Bible. Good works cannot make up for wrongs against the holy God. Compared to His holiness, \u201call our righteous acts are like filthy rags\u201d (Isaiah 64:6b).Having sinned against God, we deserve His punishment. A judge who pardons lawbreakers isn\u2019t a good judge. Likewise, God will not overlook sin. He pours out His righteous wrath against sinners (Romans 2:1-11). Unbelieving sinners pay for their sin by suffering eternal death in hell: \u201cFor the wages of sin is death\u201d (Romans 6:23a). The promise required an innocent deathAlthough God banished Adam and Eve from the garden and the tree of life, He gave them hope of salvation and paradise. He promised to send the woman\u2019s offspring\u2014Jesus\u2014Who would conquer Satan (Genesis 3:15). Until then, men would sacrifice innocent lambs as a substitute for the punishment they deserved. Sacrificing an animal showed men\u2019s humble acknowledgement that their sin required death and showed their faith in the future offspring and sacrifice from God\u2014Jesus\u2014Who would bear the believer\u2019s penalty once and for all. The prophets foretold Jesus\u2019 deathFrom Adam to Jesus, God sent prophets to mankind, warning them of sin\u2019s punishment and foretelling the coming Savior. Seven hundred years before Jesus was born, the prophet Isaiah described Him: \u201cWho has believed what they heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people? And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth. Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; when his soul makes an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors\u201d (Isaiah 53:1-12).The prophet compared the coming Savior to a lamb, slaughtered for the sins of others. Centuries later, Jesus fulfilled Isaiah\u2019s prophecy. Although Jesus is eternally one with God, God the Father sent His Son to earth (John 3:16). Jesus is the promised offspring of the woman (Genesis 3:15), born in human flesh to the virgin Mary. God witnessed that Jesus is His own Son (Matthew 17:5). On seeing Jesus, the prophet John the Baptist cried, \"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!\u201d (John 1:29). Taking the sin of the world as the sacrificial Lamb of God is why Jesus had to die. He came to take the punishment for sin\u2014death. Jesus prophesied His own death many times: \u201cAnd taking the twelve, he said to them, \u2018See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise\u2019\" (Luke 18:31-33).God sacrificed Jesus for sinDuring the life of Jesus, crowds thronged around Him for healing and teaching, but the religious leaders scorned Him. They arrested Him and charged Him with blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God (Luke 22:70). Mobs cried out, \u201cCrucify Him!\u201d Soldiers beat, mocked, and crucified Him. On the cross, Jesus bore the punishment of sin. At His death, He cried out, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John 19:30b). Jesus finished paying the punishment for sin as the perfect Lamb of God. As Isaiah prophesied, Jesus was crucified in between two criminals and was buried in a rich man\u2019s tomb. But Jesus didn\u2019t remain in the grave. As He prophesied, Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death. Why did Jesus have to die?Jesus died for believing sinners. We cannot reach paradise on our own merit. Remember, the holy God will not let sin go unpunished. If we bore our own sins, we would suffer judgment in the flames of hell. But God sacrificed Jesus as the believer\u2019s perfect Substitute. The Scripture says, \u201cFor while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified [made righteous/good] by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation [restored relationship]. \u201cTherefore, just as through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned. . . . So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men. For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous. The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\u201d (Romans 5:6-12; 18-21). Jesus died to provide the only way to eternal life. If God is showing your sin and need of Jesus, repent, turning from your sin and own way of trying to please God. You cannot fix yourself. Believing the Bible\u2019s truth about Who Jesus is and what He did, trust in Jesus as Savior from sin and follow Him as the Lord of your life. He will lead and strengthen you through His Word, the Bible.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"],

{"content": "\nIn a general sense, a prophet is a person who speaks God\u2019s truth to others. The English word\u00a0prophet\u00a0comes from the Greek word\u00a0prophetes, which can mean \u201cone who speaks forth\u201d or \u201cadvocate.\u201d Prophets are also called \u201cseers,\u201d because of their spiritual insight or their ability to \u201csee\u201d the future.In the Bible, prophets often had both a teaching and revelatory role, declaring God\u2019s truth on contemporary issues while also revealing details about the future. Isaiah\u2019s ministry, for example, touched on both the present and the future. He preached boldly against the corruption of his day (Isaiah 1:4) and delivered grand visions of the future of Israel (Isaiah 25:8).Prophets had the task of faithfully speaking God\u2019s Word to the people. They were instrumental in guiding the nation of Israel and establishing the church. God\u2019s household is \u201cbuilt on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone\u201d (Ephesians 2:20).More than 133 named prophets are mentioned in the Bible, including 16 women. In addition, numerous others prophesied, such as the 70 elders of Israel (Numbers 11:25) and the 100 prophets rescued by Obadiah (1 Kings 18:4). The first named prophet in the Bible is Abraham. In Genesis 20:7 God spoke to Abimelech in dream, saying, \u201cNow then, return [Abraham\u2019s] wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you will live.\u201d God had revealed Himself to Abraham on numerous occasions.Jacob and Joseph, descendants of Abraham, both had dreams regarding the future that could be categorized as prophetic. Moses was called a \u201cman of God\u201d and was considered a great prophet (Deuteronomy 34:10). Joshua and many of the judges served as prophets, with the last judge, Samuel, hearing the voice of God as a young boy (1 Samuel 3:4). He would later anoint David, who served as both king and prophet in Israel.The time of Elijah and Elisha was marked by a high level of prophetic activity. In fact, a school for prophets thrived during their lifetimes (see 1 Kings 20:35). Both Elijah and Elisha performed many miracles as well.In the New Testament, John the Baptist foretold the Messiah (Matthew 3:1). Jesus Himself came as prophet, priest, king, and Messiah, fulfilling many of the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.The early church also included prophets. For example, Ananias was given a prophecy about the apostle Paul\u2019s future (Acts 9:10\u201318). Acts 21:9 mentions four daughters of Philip who could prophesy. Prophecy is listed as a spiritual gift in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. In the end times, two \u201cwitnesses\u201d will prophesy from Jerusalem (Revelation 11).Usually, the prophets God sends are despised and their message unheeded. Isaiah described his nation as a \u201crebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the Lord\u2019s instruction. They say to the seers, \u2018See no more visions!\u2019 and to the prophets, \u2018Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions\u2019\u201d (Isaiah 30:9\u201310). Jesus lamented that Jerusalem had killed the prophets God sent to them (Luke 13:34).Of course, not everyone who \u201cspeaks forth\u201d a message is actually a prophet of God. The Bible warns against false prophets who claim to speak for God but who actually deceive the people they purport to inform. King Ahab kept 400 such false prophets in his employ to tell him what he wanted to hear (2 Chronicles 18:4; cf. 2 Timothy 4:3). In the New Testament we have many warnings against false prophets. Jesus taught, \u201cWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves\u201d (Matthew 7:15). He later noted that, in the end times, \u201cfalse messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect\u201d (Matthew 24:24). Revelation speaks of a false prophet who will arise in the Tribulation and deceive people around the world (Revelation 16:13; 19:20; 20:10). To avoid being led astray, we must always \u201ctest the spirits to see whether they are from God\u201d (1 John 4:1).A true prophet of God will be committed to speaking God\u2019s truth. He or she will never contradict God\u2019s revealed Word. A true prophet will say, with the prophet Micaiah just before his fateful confrontation with Ahab, \u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what my God says\u201d (2 Chronicles 18:13).", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4338, "end": 4340, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 4280, "end": 4346, "text": "\u201cAs surely as the Lord lives, I can tell him only what my God says\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 4274, "end": 4277, "text": "Ahab"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 4223, "end": 4229, "text": "Micaiah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 4160, "end": 4178, "text": "God\u2019s revealed Word"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4160, "end": 4162, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4115, "end": 4117, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4081, "end": 4083, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4045, "end": 4047, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3998, "end": 4048, "text": "\u201ctest the spirits to see whether they are from God\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 3870, "end": 3884, "text": "the Tribulation"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 3815, "end": 3824, "text": "Revelation"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3674, "end": 3796, "text": "\u201cfalse messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 3663, "end": 3671, "text": "end times"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3510, "end": 3617, "text": "\u201cWatch out for false prophets.

{"content": "n\nThe Haggadah is a book containing the liturgy that Jews read during the Seder on the first night of Passover. The word Haggadah means \u201ctelling,\u201d which comes from this biblical command: \u201cOn that day tell your son, \u2018I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt\u2019\u201d (Exodus 13:8). The festival of Passover, also known as Pesach, begins at sunset on the 14th of Nisan (usually in March or April) and marks the beginning of a seven-day celebration that includes the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The Haggadah is the printed order of service, readings, and songs used by those attending the Seder. There are minor differences in the Haggadah when the Passover Seder is observed by Sephardic (Spanish-Portuguese), Ashkenazi (Eastern European) and Misrahi (North African/Middle Eastern) Jews. Haggadah is sometimes confused with Aggadah, which is the name of a collection of texts from the Talmud or other rabbinical literature. The texts of the Aggadah include folklore, parables, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice that illustrate the meaning or purpose of laws, customs, or biblical passages. Some use the terms Haggadah and Aggadah interchangeably. Unlike most Christian holy days, which are observed in churches, Passover, since the destruction of the temple, has been celebrated in individual homes with family and friends. It is customary to invite guests, especially newcomers to the community, to share the Seder meal. In most Jewish homes, the Seder meal is an elaborate feast, with games for the children and plenty of time to tell the story of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. A Seder meal can last three to four hours. The order of the Seder, as presented in the Haggadah begins with the Kiddush (or Kadesh or Kadeish), the benediction that proclaims the holiness of the holiday. This is done over a cup of wine, the first of the four cups drunk while reclining at the Seder table. When drinking the four cups and eating the matzah (\u201cunleavened bread\u201d), Jews recline at the table to accentuate the fact that they are free people. In ancient times only free people had the luxury of reclining while eating. The Kiddush is traditionally led by the father of the house, but all Seder participants participate by reciting the Kiddush and drinking at least a majority of a cup of wine. The benediction is followed by the Ur'chatz, the washing of hands to symbolize purification. The Seder leader calls out, \u201cUr'chatz,\u201d and each one presents his or her hands for ritual cleansing. Hands are washed in the usual, ritually prescribed manner before any meal, but without the customary blessing. Following the Haggadah, the next step in the Seder is the dipping of the Karpas, the appetizer. A small piece of onion or boiled potato is dipped into saltwater and eaten, after the leader recites the blessing over the vegetables. The salt water is said to represent the tears of the Jews in bondage in Egypt. Succeeding the Karpas is the breaking of the Yachatz. Three matzahs are stacked on the Seder table, and the middle of the three is broken in half. The larger piece is hidden, to be used later as the afikoman, the \u201cdessert\u201d after the meal. The smaller piece is returned to its place between the other two matzahs. This broken middle matzah symbolizes humility and will be eaten later as the \u201cbread of poverty.\u201d Now, according to the Haggadah, is the time for the Magid. This begins with the Ha Lachma Anya, an invitation of the poor to join the Seder. Then the story of Passover and the deliverance from slavery to freedom is told. The matzahs are uncovered and referred to as the \u201cbread of affliction.\u201d At this point, the four questions (Mah Nishtanah) are asked. It is customary for the youngest child present to recite the four questions: Why do we eat only matzah? Why do we eat only bitter herbs? Why do we dip our herbs twice? Why are we relaxing and leaning on cushions as if we were kings? The answers include a brief review of history, a description of the suffering imposed upon the Israelites, a listing of the plagues visited on the Egyptians, and an enumeration of the miracles performed by the Almighty for the redemption of His people. At this part in the Seder, the Haggadah states that songs of praise are to be sung, including the song \u201cDayenu,\u201d which proclaims that, had God performed only one of His many deeds on behalf of His people, it would have been enough to obligate us to give thanks. A long blessing is recited, followed by the drinking of the second cup of wine. Next is the Rohtzah. The hands are washed again, this time with the customary blessings, as is usually done before eating bread. This is followed by the Motzi Matzah (\u201cblessings over the matzah\u201d). Two blessings are recited: the standard blessing before eating bread, which includes the words who brings forth (motzi in Hebrew), and then the blessing regarding the commandment to eat matzah. Following the Motzi Matzah, the Maror (bitter herbs) are eaten. The blessing for the eating of the Maror is recited, and then it is dipped into the charoset and eaten. The charoset is a paste made of apples, nuts, and wine. At this point, according to the Haggadah, a sandwich (Koreich) is made of two pieces of the bottom matzah and the bitter herbs dipped in the charoset, and the sandwich is eaten. This is followed by the Shulchan Orech, the full Seder meal. Traditionally, the meal begins with the charred egg dipped in salt water. After the meal, the Tzafun occurs. The afikoman, which was hidden earlier in the Seder, is taken out and eaten. This symbolizes the Paschal lamb, which in ancient times was eaten at the end of the meal. After the consumption of the afikoman, the Haggadah forbids any other food to be eaten for the rest of the night\u2014and no more intoxicating beverages, except for the remaining two cups of wine. Next in the order of the Haggadah comes the Bareich, the blessings after the meal. These include the Kos Shlishi (\u201cthe third cup of wine\u201d) and the Kos shel Eliyahu ha-Navi (\u201cthe cup of Elijah the Prophet\u201d). In many traditions, the front door of the house is opened at this point, which is an invitation to the prophet Elijah, the harbinger of the coming of Moshiach, the righteous Messiah. At this point, the Hallel (\u201csongs of praise\u201d) is recited, recognizing the Almighty and His unique guidance of the Jewish people. After reciting the Hallel, a blessing over wine is recited, and the fourth cup is drunk. The Haggadah has the Seder conclude with a prayer (the Nirtzah). This prayer expresses a desire that the service be accepted by God and a hope for the coming of the Messiah: \u201cL'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim!\u201d (\u201cnext year in Jerusalem!\u201d). Jews in Israel, and especially those in Jerusalem, change the wording slightly: \u201cL'shanah haba'ah b'Yerushalayim hab'nuyah!\u201d (\u201cnext year in the rebuilt Jerusalem!\u201d)", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 6720, "end": 6723, "text": "Jews"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 6486, "end": 6493, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 5899, "end": 5906, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 5725, "end": 5732, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 5393, "end": 5402, "text": "Seder meal"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 5198, "end": 5205, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 4240, "end": 4247, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 4051, "end": 4060, "text": "Israelites"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 3528, "end": 3535, "text": "Passover"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 3391, "end": 3398, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2933, "end": 2936, "text": "Jews"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2663, "end": 2670, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 2348, "end": 2358, "text": "benediction"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2017, "end": 2020, "text": "Jews"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 1787, "end": 1797, "text": "benediction"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1726, "end": 1733, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 1641, "end": 1650, "text": "Seder meal"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1616, "end": 1625, "text": "Israelites"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 1496, "end": 1505, "text": "Seder meal"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 1458, "end": 1467, "text": "Seder meal"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 1260, "end": 1267, "text": "Passover"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 1207, "end": 1225, "text": "Christian holy days"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1157, "end": 1164, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 904, "end": 909, "text": "Talmud"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 807, "end": 814, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "Jews"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 667, "end": 674, "text": "Passover"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 649, "end": 656, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 517, "end": 524, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 319, "end": 326, "text": "Passover"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 120, "end": 127, "text": "Haggadah"}]}, {"label": ["major_biblical_events"], "points": [{"start": 101, "end": 108, "text": "Passover"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 52, "end": 55, "text": "Jews"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 5, "end": 12, "text": "Haggadah"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541291536000, "last_updated_at": 1541291536000, "sec_taken": 208, "last_updated_by": "HgM0yM1HlZNxjHRR0juGbaQsu2n2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
{"content": "n\nAn allegory is a literary work in which the characters and events are symbolic of a deeper moral or spiritual truth. The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and The Holy War by John Bunyan are famous allegories. The Song of Solomon is often interpreted as an allegory by both Jewish and Christian scholars. Jews have seen it as an allegory of God\u2019s love, while Christians have often viewed the book as an allegory of Christ\u2019s love for the Church. The book is lyric, poetic, and rich in symbolism, but can it properly be called an allegory? Because of the romantic and even sexual nature of the book\u2019s contents, many have sought a different way to understand its message. However, an allegorical approach is unnecessary to understanding the intended meaning of the Song of Solomon. The straightforward approach to the Song of Solomon shows it is a love poem written by Solomon regarding a woman he loves. The book includes many intimate details regarding the love between a man and a woman; those details are cloaked in symbolism, but chapter 4 is obviously a poetic description of the consummation of a marriage on the wedding night. There is no need to allegorize this, since its presentation of connubial love is completely consistent with the Bible\u2019s other teachings regarding marriage. In the poem the wedding takes place prior to the consummation of sexual relations between the lover and his beloved (Song of Solomon 3:6\u201311). The wedding night is symbolically described in 4:1\u20145:1, and then 5:2\u20138:4 addresses the maturing of the marriage relationship. The beloved concludes, \u201cMany waters cannot quench love; / rivers cannot sweep it away\u201d (Song of Solomon 8:7). There is nothing in the book to suggest it\u2019s anything but a lyrical presentation of what actually took place between King Solomon and his true love. There are no supernatural events or apocalyptic beasts; there is nothing that must be understood as allegorical, and there is no need to spiritualize the text. A major concern with an allegorical approach to the Song of Solomon is that the meaning of the allegory is debatable. The lover is usually seen as God or Christ, with the beloved as either God\u2019s people (Israel) or the Church. While the Church is called the bride of Christ (Ephesians 5; Revelation 19:7), this does not mean the bride in the Song of Solomon must be seen from this perspective. The Church did not exist at the time the Song of Solomon was composed. Unless speaking prophetically, the book cannot refer to the Church. Could Solomon have written the book as an allegory of God\u2019s love for the Jewish people? God loves Israel (Hosea 3:1), but this does not require the Song of Solomon to be an allegory about Israel. There may be applications relevant to God\u2019s love for His people, but this is different from interpreting the book as an allegory. The Song of Solomon can be read and interpreted just as it was written, as a love poem. It offers an intimate look of the growth, joy, and maturation of love between a man and woman. It can thus offer much insight for married life today. The Song of Solomon can also be seen as an illustration of God\u2019s love for His people, but it is not an allegory, per se.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3131, "end": 3133, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 3116, "end": 3118, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 3057, "end": 3075, "text": "The Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 2995, "end": 2999, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 2987, "end": 2989, "text": "man"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2819, "end": 2837, "text": "The Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2742, "end": 2744, "text": "His"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2727, "end": 2729, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2637, "end": 2655, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2581, "end": 2583, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 2566, "end": 2571, "text": "Jewish"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2547, "end": 2549, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2391, "end": 2409, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2298, "end": 2316, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2227, "end": 2232, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2150, "end": 2152, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 2115, "end": 2120, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2108, "end": 2110, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2009, "end": 2027, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 1565, "end": 1627, "text": "\u201cMany waters cannot quench love; / rivers cannot sweep it away\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1230, "end": 1234, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 967, "end": 971, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 957, "end": 959, "text": "man"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 872, "end": 876, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 797, "end": 815, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 744, "end": 762, "text": "the Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["jesus"], "points": [{"start": 401, "end": 406, "text": "Christ"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 345, "end": 353, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 327, "end": 329, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 271, "end": 279, "text": "Christian"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 260, "end": 265, "text": "Jewish"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 196, "end": 214, "text": "The Song of Solomon"}]}, {"label": ["church_history_characters"], "points": [{"start": 161, "end": 171, "text": "John Bunyan"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541283633000, "last_updated_at": 1541283633000, "sec_taken": 520, "last_updated_by": "zRpwhN8op5VLgO5qS85ODIkvQSY2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
{"content": "\nWhile certain aspects of dispensational theology have been present throughout church history, the system of dispensational theology was not formalized until John Nelson Darby began teaching it in the mid-1800s. Dispensational theology first became popular in the days of Cyrus Scofield with the publication of the Scofield Reference Bible in the early 1900s. The better part of wisdom says that, if someone is the first person in 2,000 years of church history to think of something, it should be seriously questioned. After all, if it is a true and important doctrine, surely God would have revealed it to someone much earlier in church history. What are the implications of this principle for dispensational theology? Should dispensational theology be rejected because it is new? There are two key points to consider. First, while a new doctrine should be viewed skeptically, newness alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection. Every system of theology was new when it was first understood and organized. The only true test of a doctrine is whether or not it is biblical. Is it taught in the Bible (2 Timothy 3:16\u201317)? Does it contradict any clear teaching of Scripture (Psalm 119:160; John 17:17)? Agreement with the Word of God is the only foolproof standard by which to evaluate a doctrine. Dispensational theology should stand or fall by comparing it with Scripture. Its newness should not be the determining factor in its evaluation. Second, while dispensational theology as an organized system is new, the concepts that comprise dispensational theology are not. The teaching of a literal millennial kingdom can be found as early as \u201cThe Shepherd of Hermas,\u201d written in the middle of the second century AD. Belief in there being a distinction between Israel and the church in God\u2019s program for the ages did not become prominent until Israel became a nation again in 1948. After all, how can there be a distinction between Israel and the church if there is no such thing as Israel? But, even with that in mind, there were believers who rejected the idea that the church replaced Israel prior to Israel\u2019s becoming a nation again. The only significant aspect of dispensational theology that has little to no support in church history is the concept of the pretribulational rapture. While some see hints of a belief in a pretibulational rapture in \u201cThe Shepherd of Hermas,\u201d there definitely was no one explicitly advocating the concept until the 1800s. This fact should cause all Bible interpreters, whether dispensational or non-dispensational, to examine the issue closely. But, again, the relative newness of a particular teaching is not the core issue. The question always has to be, is it biblical? If dispensational theology is true, why did God wait so long before revealing it? Perhaps God wanted other more important doctrines to be developed first. Perhaps God chose to reveal dispensational theology in recent centuries due to the fact that the end times are approaching. The \u201cwhy\u201d cannot be explicitly answered, biblically. The key point is this\u2014dispensational theology as a whole, and each of its core doctrines, should be evaluated using Scripture. It should be accepted or rejected based on whether or not it is in agreement with the Word of God.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}],

{"content": "n\nThe first recorded instance of Jesus saying, \u201cYour faith has made you well\u201d is found in Matthew 9:22 (ESV) where Jesus heals the woman with the issue of blood. The KJV translates Jesus\u2019 words as \u201cThy faith hath made thee whole,\u201d and the NIV says, \u201cYour faith has healed you.\u201d The same incident is also recorded in Mark 5:34, where Jesus says, \u201cDaughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease\u201d (ESV). Jesus also says, \u201cYour faith has made you well,\u201d to the ten lepers (Luke 17:19) and a blind beggar (Luke 18:42). Other times Jesus links faith and healing without using the exact words, \u201cYour faith has made you well,\u201d such as in Matthew 8:13 and 15:28. The healing that these people experienced is expressed, in Greek, by a form of the word sozo, which means \u201cto preserve, rescue, save from death, or keep alive.\u201d Sometimes, sozo refers to spiritual salvation, which is also linked to a person\u2019s faith. For example, when the penitent prostitute washed Jesus\u2019 feet with her tears, He told her much the same thing: \u201cYour faith has saved you\u201d (Luke 7:50; for other examples, see Mark 10:52 and Luke 17:19). When Jesus spoke of the faith of the woman with the issue of blood in Matthew 9, His healing was very likely more than physical; it was a spiritual healing as well, as she is told to \u201cgo in peace\u201d (Mark 5:34). When Jesus said to certain people, \u201cYour faith has made you well,\u201d He was saying that their faith (their confidence in Him) had been the means of their restoration. The power of Christ was what effected the cure, but His power was applied in connection with their faith. Just as the faith of some enabled them to receive healing, so healing was sometimes stymied by a lack of faith (see Matthew 13:58). In the same way, salvation comes to a sinner through faith. Everyone who is saved must believe, but it is the power of Christ that saves, not the power of faith. Faith is only the instrument, not the power itself. In other words, the value of one\u2019s faith does not come from the one who expresses it but from the object in which it rests (Mark 10:52; 11:22). Ultimately, healing is not contingent upon the quality of one\u2019s faith, but upon the Healer. It was through Christ that the woman in Matthew 9 was able to receive a bodily peace as well as a spiritual peace. We must recognize that Jesus did not indiscriminately heal all the people all of the time. For example, in the scene of the disabled man at the pool of Bethesda where multitudes gathered to be healed, Jesus chose only one man to heal (John 5:1\u201311), and his is an interesting case. Jesus asked the man if he wanted to be made well. His answer was steeped in superstition: there was no one to carry him to the pool, and he wasn\u2019t fast enough to get into the water at the right time. This confused and needy man was healed by God\u2019s grace. He had no faith in Jesus; he didn\u2019t even know it was Jesus who had healed him until later (John 5:12\u201313). Another example of someone who was healed before faith is the man born blind in John 9. He did not ask to be healed, but from many others, he was chosen to be healed\u2014another example of God\u2019s grace. In the case of the man born blind and in the case of the man at the pool, Jesus dealt with their physical problems separately from dealing with their spiritual need\u2014the man in John 9 later comes to a full realization of who Jesus is and exercises faith in Him (verse 38).

{"content": "\nThe Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is an organization directed by the leaders of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. The Watchtower Society was founded in 1886 and is currently located in Brooklyn, New York. The Watchtower possesses tremendous control over its members and has gone so far as to produce its own translation of the Bible called the New World Translation. The Society has gone through several presidents since its founding and has positioned itself as a major competitor to evangelical Christianity. While claiming to be the only legitimate followers of Jehovah God, the Watchtower denies and even opposes several of the fundamental doctrines of the historic Christian faith.  To begin with, the Watchtower gets wrong one of the most important of all religious questions: Who is Jesus Christ? The Watchtower Society teaches that Jesus Christ is actually the first creation of Jehovah God, not God incarnate as the Bible clearly teaches (Titus 2:13; Colossians 2:9). In doing so, they have placed Christ in the category of creature rather than acknowledging His rightful place of Creator of all things (Colossians 1:16-17; John 1:1-3). They have repeated the deadly error of Arianism, which was condemned as heresy by the Christian Church at the Council of Nicea and is easily refuted by a fair reading of Scripture.  Since its inception, the Watchtower has denied the biblical teaching of the triune God (one Being who exists as three co-equal, co-eternal Persons) and gone so far as to say that the God of Christianity is a satanic counterfeit. Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and a former President of the Society, even referred to the Christian concept of God as, \u201cthe devil himself.\u201d The God of the Watchtower is not the biblical God and is therefore not capable of saving people from their sins.  In an attempt to justify their doctrines through biblical exegesis, the Society produced their own translation of the Scriptures in 1961. This translation, known as the New World Translation, is regarded by the Jehovah's Witnesses as the only faithful rendering of the biblical text. The NWT is unique in that it is the first intentional, systematic effort at producing a complete version of the Bible that is edited and revised for the specific purpose of agreeing with a group\u2019s doctrine. Greek scholars from across the theological spectrum have repeatedly criticized the NWT as an inaccurate rendering of key biblical passages.  The late Dr. Bruce Metzger, formerly Professor of New Testament Language at Princeton Theological Seminary and author of several highly acclaimed books on textual criticism, stated, \u201cThe Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have incorporated in their translations of the New Testament several quite erroneous renderings of the Greek.\u201d Dr. Robert Countess, who completed his Ph.D. dissertation in Greek on the New World Translation, is on record as saying that the Watchtower\u2019s translation \u201chas been sharply unsuccessful in keeping doctrinal considerations from influencing the actual translation. It must be viewed as a radically biased piece of work. At some points it is actually dishonest.\u201d  A further reason to reject the claims of the Watchtower is their long history of engaging in false prophecy. The Watchtower Society has on numerous occasions predicted in print the end of the world, the most recent dates being in 1946, 1950, and 1975. What makes their false prophecy all the more damning is when their false predictions are seen in the light of their claim to be 'the true prophetic mouthpiece for God on earth at this time.' The Society's history of false prophecy stands in stark contrast to the standard for a true prophet laid out in Scripture: 'If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him' (Deuteronomy 18:22).  Moreover, the Watchtower continues to engage in cultic manipulation of its people through the prohibition of military service, the celebration of holidays, and the saluting of the nation's flag. The impetus for these restrictions is rooted in their false claim to be the exclusive organized collection of Jehovah's people. The Watchtower views these practices as devices of Satan to lead people away from Jehovah. The Watchtower sees the entire \u201cworld system\u201d (any activity not connected with the Watchtower) as connected to Satan and is thus prohibited. This would include the practice of blood transfusions, which the Watchtower wrongly believes to be prohibited by Scripture. The Watchtower has stated that a blood transfusion 'may result in the immediate and very temporary prolongation of life, but at the cost of eternal life for a dedicated Christian.' The Society wrongly assumes that the biblical prohibition against eating blood (Genesis 9:4; Acts 15:28-29) extends all the way to the modern practice of blood transfusions, a restriction that, in practice, has cost the very lives of many Jehovah's Witnesses and even their children.  Despite a track record of repeated false prophecies, a cultic isolation of their own people, and a flagrant mistranslation of the Bible to justify their own theology, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society continues to gain unsuspecting converts every year. It is the job of biblically faithful Christians to be prepared to refute these errors with sound doctrine (Titus 1:9).

{"content": "\nThe modern term \u201cworkaholic\u201d is not found anywhere in the Bible. However, biblical principles can be brought to bear on the discussion of workaholics\u2014those whose devotion to their career, job, or ministry has reached the point of obsessiveness. Anything obsessed about, other than God, is an idol. As Christians, we have to be very careful not to let the cares and allurements of the world distract us from our devotion to Christ. Workaholics are people who are addicted to their work in much the same way an alcoholic is addicted to alcohol. Such a person rarely rests. He is constantly worried about the next sale, business deal, commission check, or task. A workaholic businessman often has difficulty seeing his friends as merely friends and not business prospects. A workaholic pastor runs the risk of seeing people more as aids or obstacles to a project than as individuals in need of ministry.As Christians, our focus on life is to be less on our vocation and more on how our vocation fits into God\u2019s plan for our life. Certainly, work is a blessed activity. The first man was given work to do by God (Genesis 2:15). A secular job is not forbidden in Scripture. We know that Paul was a tentmaker and Luke a physician. And, of course, there is much work to do in \u201cfull-time ministry\u201d jobs as well. Jesus told us to pray for \u201cworkers\u201d to serve in God\u2019s harvest (Luke 10:2). But both in the ministry and in secular work, we need a balance. Rest and recreation are also God\u2019s design (Genesis 2:2). One good test to know whether we are too focused on our jobs is to ask ourselves how much time we spend thinking about our jobs when we are not actually at work. If more of our thoughts are centered on our jobs than on God, we may be in danger.Even when involved in the seemingly mundane tasks of a job, our hearts should be turned to heaven. We should glorify God in all that we do. We should maintain a good work ethic in our employment by doing things as Christ would, with honor and to the best of our ability. As Paul reminded the Colossians, \u201cAnd whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him\u201d (Colossians 3:17). In all things, we should echo the psalmist\u2019s prayer in Psalm 19:14, \u201cLet the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.\u201d Workaholics never have time to meditate in their hearts on the Word of God.Being a workaholic isn\u2019t directly comparable to worshipping idols. However, if the job takes up so much energy that it distracts from the relationship with Jesus Christ having predominance, then it could be considered idolatry. We should view our employment as opportunities to advance the kingdom of God through our talents and finances. We should be very strategic in our approach and have a balanced life where we are more focused on Jesus Christ than on our vocation.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 2270, "end": 2391, "text": "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 2049, "end": 2180, "text": "\u201cAnd whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2019, "end": 2022, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1207, "end": 1210, "text": "Luke"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1182, "end": 1185, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 58, "end": 62, "text": "Bible"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541274119000, "last_updated_at": 1541274119000, "sec_taken": 0, "last_updated_by": "HgM0yM1HlZNxjHRR0juGbaQsu2n2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "\nFirst Corinthians 14:33\u201335 states, \u201cAs in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church\u201d (ESV). At first glance, this seems to be a blanket command that women are never allowed to speak at all in the church. However, earlier in the same epistle (1 Corinthians 11:5), Paul mentions situations where women are allowed to pray and prophesy in the assembled congregation. Therefore, 1 Corinthians 14:33\u201335 must not be an absolute command for women to remain silent at all times in all services. The prohibition must be limited in some way by the context. The concern of 1 Corinthians 14 is the orderly assembly of the congregation. The church of Corinth was noted for the chaos and lack of order rampant in that assembly (verse 33). Everyone in the church service was participating with whatever expression they desired, whenever they desired, as loudly as they desired. Those with the gift of tongues were speaking simultaneously, and no one was concerned with interpreting what was being said. Those with a revelation from God were shouting out randomly, even if what was said could not be heard above the din, and apparently no one was evaluating what was being offered as prophecy. The meetings were characterized by chaos, and no one was being edified or instructed (see verses 5, 12, and 19). To remedy this problem, Paul instructs a number of people/groups to \u201cbe quiet\u201d at certain times and under certain conditions: \u2022 Verses 27\u201328a, \u201cIf any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church.\u201d \u2022 Verses 29\u201331a, \u201cLet two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. For you can all prophesy one by one.\u201d \u2022 Verses 34\u201335, \u201cThe women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.\u201d As we have already noted, women are allowed to pray and prophesy in church in 1 Corinthians 11:5, so 1 Corinthians 14:34\u201335 cannot be an absolute prohibition against all types of speaking by all women at all times. As evident from the commands to tongues-speakers and prophets, certain other people are also prohibited from speaking at certain times and for certain reasons. The context gives us some clues as to what is going on. First, the command for women to remain silent seems to deal with two important issues: proper order in the church and proper demonstration or acknowledgment of authority. Apparently, some women were speaking out in a way that did not acknowledge the spiritual authority of either their husbands or church leaders. This issue is addressed in 1 Corinthians 11 as well. Women are allowed to pray and prophesy, as long as they have their heads covered to show proper respect for spiritual authority. (In the first century, the head covering was the sign of a chaste, respectful woman, so women in the church were not to cast it off; to do so was to convey insolence or impropriety, according to the contemporary culture. Today, head coverings do not communicate the same message, so most evangelical interpreters stress that the attitude of respect, displayed by culturally significant symbols, is important, not a head covering specifically.) We might envision Paul saying, \u201cIf a woman wants to pray or prophesy in church, let her do so while showing the proper respect for church authority; otherwise, let her remain silent.\u201d The Greek word gunaikes in 1 Corinthians 14:34 can mean either \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cwife,\u201d depending on the context. The mention of husbands in verse 35 might indicate that \u201cwife\u201d is intended and that only married women are to be silent in the church. However, limiting the application of the Paul\u2019s injunction to married women doesn\u2019t really solve the problem: in the ancient world marriage was usually seen as an elevation of status. If married women are enjoined to be silent, how much more would single women have been expected to sit quietly? The various possible interpretations of 1 Corinthians 14:34\u201335 are too numerous to recount here. The best explanation takes into account the surrounding context and resolves the tension between 1 Corinthians 11 and 14. The immediate context has to do with the delivery of prophecy and the deliberation about the prophecy. If someone offers a prophecy to the church in the public meeting, the church is to pass judgment upon it (1 Corinthians 14:29). That is, the church is to weigh it and evaluate it to see if it is truly from God and, if so, what actions should be taken. It seems that the best contextual understanding is that women are to keep silent in this deliberative process, since evaluating prophecy is an exercise of spiritual authority. Further complications could also arise: what if a wife questioned her husband\u2019s prophecy or disagreed with her husband\u2019s evaluation of a prophecy? In that case, it would be proper for her to hold her peace in the assembly and ask him about it privately at home (verse 35). This would show respect for her husband\u2019s spiritual authority and minimize the possibility of disorder in the church. (Although not mentioned in the passage, a husband may have found it wise to \u201crecuse himself\u201d if his wife\u2019s prophecy came under scrutiny!) Paul\u2019s original intent in 1 Corinthians 14:33\u201335 seems to be that a woman must not take part in the deliberative process of evaluating prophecies. The question remains about how this command is to be applied today. In both 1 Corinthians 11 and 14, Paul is keen to maintain male spiritual leadership in the home and church as a universal principle (see also 1 Timothy 2:12). Pastors and elders are men, and women come under that authority with the rest of the church. How this submission to authority is acknowledged and applied may differ based on current cultural practices. If a head covering (as in chapter 11) is the culturally appropriate symbol of a woman\u2019s chastity and submissiveness, then a head covering should be worn. If that symbol passes from currency, then it may be discarded in favor of other culturally relevant symbols. In modern Western culture, modest clothing would certainly be a relevant symbol. Other symbols, such as a wife taking her husband\u2019s last name, might have held much significance at one time in American culture but may now be less significant. There may be another reason, rooted in culture, for the command for women to remain silent in the church. For a first-century woman to participate in a deliberative action in any assembly would have been considered a usurpation of authority. Perhaps in today\u2019s culture, where women are invited to participate, their silence is not required in the church in order to show proper respect to their husbands or church leadership. The interpretation offered here maintains that, as long the male leadership in the home and church is honored and female acceptance of it is expressed in culturally relevant ways, then the spirit of the passage is fulfilled.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 7360, "end": 7365, "text": "female"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 7096, "end": 7100, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 6946, "end": 6950, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 6888, "end": 6892, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 6605, "end": 6619, "text": "modest clothing"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 6439, "end": 6451, "text": "head covering"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 6395, "end": 6399, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 6320, "end": 6332, "text": "head covering"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 6145, "end": 6149, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 5987, "end": 5990, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 5807, "end": 5811, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 5739, "end": 5742, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 5708, "end": 5715, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 5525, "end": 5543, "text": "spiritual authority"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 5347, "end": 5354, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 5290, "end": 5297, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 5189, "end": 5207, "text": "spiritual authority"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 5162, "end": 5169, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 5090, "end": 5094, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 4988, "end": 4990, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 4802, "end": 4809, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts"], "points": [{"start": 4772, "end": 4779, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["spiritual_gifts", "christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 4732, "end": 4739, "text": "prophecy"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 4419, "end": 4423, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 4359, "end": 4363, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["marital_status"], "points": [{"start": 4351, "end": 4357, "text": "married"}]}, {"label": ["marital_status"], "points": [{"start": 4295, "end": 4302, "text": "marriage"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 4234, "end": 4238, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["marital_status"], "points": [{"start": 4226, "end": 4232, "text": "married"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 4205, "end": 4208, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 4126, "end": 4130, "text": "women"}]}, {"label": ["marital_status"], "points": [{"start": 4118, "end": 4124, "text": "married"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 3985, "end": 3989, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["theological_terminology"], "points": [{"start": 3868, "end": 3883, "text": "church authority"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 3797, "end": 3804, "text": "prophesy"}]}, {"label": ["christian_practice"], "points": [{"start": 3789, "end": 3792, "text": "pray"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 3774, "end": 3778, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 3768, "end": 3919, "text": "\u201cIf a woman wants to pray or prophesy in church, let her do so while showing the proper respect for church authority;

{"content": "The apostle Paul instructed the Corinthian believers to not go to court against one another (1 Corinthians 6:1-8). For Christians not to forgive each other and reconcile their own differences is to demonstrate spiritual defeat. Why would someone want to become a Christian if Christians have just as many problems and are just as incapable of solving them? However, there are some instances when a lawsuit might be the proper course of action. If the biblical pattern for reconciliation has been followed (Matthew 18:15-17) and the offending party is still in the wrong, in some instances a lawsuit might be justified. This should only be done after much prayer for wisdom (James 1:5) and consultation with spiritual leadership.The whole context of 1 Corinthians 6:1-6 deals with disputes in the church, but Paul does reference the court system when he speaks of judgments concerning things pertaining to this life. Paul means that the court system exists for matters of this life that are outside the church. Church problems should not be taken to the court system, but should be judged within the church.Acts chapters 21\"22 talk about Paul being arrested and wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit. The Romans arrested him and \"the commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime. He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious. As they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer standing there, \"Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?\"\" Paul used the Roman law and his citizenship to protect himself. There is nothing wrong with using the court system as long as it is done with a right motive and a pure heart.Paul further declares, \"Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?\" (1 Corinthians 6:7). The thing Paul is concerned with here is the testimony of the believer. It would be far better for us to be taken advantage of, or even abused, than it would be for us to push a person even further away from Christ by taking him/her to court. Which is more important\"a legal battle or the battle for a person\"s eternal soul?In summary, should Christians take each other to court over church matters? Absolutely not! Should Christians take each other to court over civil matters? If it can in any way be avoided, no. Should Christians take non-Christians to court over civil matters? Again, if it can be avoided, no.

{"content": "\nThe event usually referred to as \u201cthe end of the world\u201d is described in 2 Peter 3:10: \u201cThe heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.\u201d This is the culmination of a series of events called \u201cthe day of the Lord,\u201d the time when God will intervene in human history for the purpose of judgment. At that time, all that God has created, \u201cthe heavens and the earth\u201d (Genesis 1:1), He will destroy. The timing of this event, according to most Bible scholars, is at the end of the 1000-year period called the millennium. During these 1000 years, Christ will reign on earth as King in Jerusalem, sitting on the throne of David (Luke 1:32-33) and ruling in peace but with a \u201crod of iron\u201d (Revelation 19:15). At the end of the 1000 years, Satan will be released, defeated again, and then cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:7-10). Then, after a final judgment by God, the end of the world described in 2 Peter 3:10 occurs. The Bible tells us several things about this event. First, it will be cataclysmic in scope. The \u201cheavens\u201d refers to the physical universe \u2013 the stars, planets, and galaxies\u2014which will be consumed by some kind of tremendous explosion, possibly a nuclear or atomic reaction that will consume and obliterate all matter as we know it. All the elements that make up the universe will be melted in the \u201cfervent heat\u201d (2 Peter 3:12). This will also be a noisy event, described in different Bible versions as a \u201croar\u201d (NIV), a \u201cgreat noise\u201d (KJV), a \u201cloud noise\u201d (CEV), and a \u201cthunderous crash\u201d (AMP). There will be no doubt as to what is happening. Everyone will see and hear it because we are also told that \u201cthe earth and everything in it will be laid bare.\u201d Then God will create a \u201cnew heaven and a new earth\u201d (Revelation 21:1), which will include the \u201cNew Jerusalem\u201d (v. 2), the capital city of heaven, a place of perfect holiness, which will come down from heaven to the new earth. This is the city where the saints\u2014those whose names were written in the \u201cLamb\u2019s book of life\u201d (Revelation 13:8)\u2014will live forever. Peter refers to this new creation as \u201cthe home of righteousness\u201d (2 Peter 3:13). Perhaps the most important part of Peter\u2019s description of that day is his question in verses 11-12: \u201cSince everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming.\u201d Christians know what is going to happen, and we should live in a way that reflects that understanding.

{"content": "n\nHistorically, baptism has been used as a rite of initiation, showing the inductee\u2019s entrance into a new belief or observance. Baptism in the church is also a token of the forgiveness of sins we experience at salvation\u2014in much the same way that Pilate attempted to show his innocence by washing his hands with water (Matthew 27:24), Christians show they are cleansed by Christ when they are baptized by water. Some Bible students have identified seven baptisms in Scripture. The seven baptisms are usually listed as being these: 1) The baptism of Moses (1 Corinthians 10:1\u20133) \u2013 when the Israelites were delivered from slavery in Egypt, they were \u201cbaptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.\u201d That is, they were identified with Moses and his deliverance by passing through the Red Sea and following God\u2019s presence in the cloud (Exodus 13:21). Paul uses this as a comparison to the way that Christians are identified with Christ and His salvation. Those who followed Moses passed through the water and were thus initiated into a new life of freedom and Law-keeping; those who follow Jesus Christ, who is greater than Moses, pass through the waters of baptism and are thus initiated to a new life of freedom and grace. 2) The baptism of John (Mark 1:4) \u2013 as John the Baptist preached repentance of sins in preparation for the coming of the Messiah, he baptized people in the Jordan. Those who were baptized by John were showing their faith in John\u2019s message and their need to confess their sin. In Acts 18:24\u201325, a disciple of John\u2019s named Apollos preaches in Ephesus; however, only knowing the baptism of John and the need for repentance, he needed to be further instructed in the death and resurrection of Christ. Later in the same city, Acts 19:1\u20137, Paul encounters some more followers of John. These disciples had been baptized for repentance, but they had not heard of the new birth or the Holy Spirit. Paul taught them the whole message of salvation in Christ, and they received the message and were subsequently baptized in Jesus\u2019 name. 3) The baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:13\u201317) \u2013 this was Jesus\u2019 act of identifying with sinful humanity. Although Jesus did not need to repent of sin, He came to John to be baptized. John balked at performing the baptism, saying that Jesus should be the one baptizing him (Matthew 3:13\u201314). But Jesus told John to proceed with the baptism: \u201cLet it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness\u201d (verse 15). In this baptism, Jesus put His stamp of approval on John\u2019s ministry and also began His own. As Jesus came up from the water, the Father spoke from heaven, and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form upon Jesus (verses 16\u201317). 4) The baptism of fire (Matthew 3:11\u201312) \u2013 John prophesied that Jesus would baptize men \u201cwith fire.\u201d This speaks of Jesus\u2019 judging the world for its sin (see John 5:22). Immediately after mentioning the baptism by fire, John describes Jesus as overseeing a harvest to come: \u201cHis winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire\u201d (verse 12; cf. Matthew 13:24\u201330, 36\u201343). Those who are judged by Christ in the last day will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:15). 5) The baptism of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:13\u201314; 1 Corinthians 12:13) \u2013 John also predicted that Jesus would baptize men with the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:11). This is a spiritual baptism, and it is the baptism that saves us. At salvation, we are \u201cimmersed\u201d in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit covers us, indwells us, fills us, and makes us a part of the spiritual body of Christ. The baptism of the Spirit is what initiates us into new life in Christ. The first people to experience the baptism of the Spirit were the believers in Acts 2 on the Day of Pentecost. The spiritual entity known as the body of Christ is formed by this baptism: \u201cWe were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body\u201d (1 Corinthians 12:13). 6) The baptism of the cross (Mark 10:35\u201339) \u2013 Jesus used the language of baptism to refer to His sufferings (and those of His disciples). James and John, the Boanerges, had come to Jesus asking for a place of honor in the kingdom. Jesus asked them, \u201cCan you . . . be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\u201d (Mark 10:38). They replied that they could, and Jesus confirmed it: \u201cYou will . . . be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with\u201d (verse 39). The \u201cbaptism\u201d Jesus speaks of here is the suffering He was to endure. James and John would suffer, as well. 7) The baptism of believers (Matthew 28:19) \u2013 this is a washing in water to symbolize the action of the Holy Spirit in a believer\u2019s heart. Believer\u2019s baptism is one of the two ordinances given to the church. Different churches practice different modes of baptism, but all who follow Christ should be baptized, since it is commanded by our Lord. Water baptism pictures some wonderful spiritual truths. When we are saved, we are \u201cburied\u201d with Christ and \u201crise\u201d to newness of life; our sins are \u201cwashed away,\u201d and we are cleansed. It is Spirit baptism that saves us, but water baptism is our outward expression of that event. \u201cAll of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death[.] We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life\u201d (Romans 6:3\u20134). Of the seven baptisms found in Scripture, only two are of personal significance to the Christian today: the baptism of the Holy Spirit (that saves us) and believer\u2019s water baptism (that identifies us with the church). The other baptisms were uniquely for other times, limited to certain people, or (in the case of the baptism of fire) still future.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent",

{"content": "\n\u201cMarriage equality\u201d is the latest catchphrase to be thrown into the gay marriage / same-sex marriage debate. The term \u201cmarriage equality\u201d is an attempt to reframe the conversation and ascribe a certain level of irrationality to those who oppose same-sex marriage. To oppose the recognition of homosexual unions as marriages is one thing. But it is much more difficult to oppose \u201cequality\u201d in marriage rights. What American would deny equality? However, attaching a new label to the cause does not change the core issues in the debate. If \u201cmarriage equality\u201d means \u201cgay marriage,\u201d Christians should be opposed to it. Why are Christians opposed to marriage equality? The question itself is misleading. Not all Christians are opposed to marriage equality, gay marriage, or whatever else it is called. Many Christians support gay unions being legally recognized as marriages. Such Christians generally hold that sexual morality should not be legislated and that, in a free society, people should be able to marry whomever they want. Biblically speaking, this is a tragic mistake. The Bible is abundantly clear that homosexuality is an unnatural sin (Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9). The Bible presents marriage as God\u2019s invention, and God has defined it as a covenant between a man and a woman for a lifetime (Genesis 2:24; 1 Corinthians 7:2-16; Ephesians 5:23-33). Biblically speaking, a homosexual union is not a marriage. It does not matter if the government legislates a new definition of marriage. It does not matter if society is overwhelmingly in favor of same-sex marriage. A homosexual union always has been, and always will be, a perversion of God\u2019s creation. In modern societies that are increasingly secular and non-Christian, the marriage equality debate is eventually going to be won by the gay rights movement. Barring national repentance and a revival of the Christian faith, gay unions are going to be officially recognized as valid marriages, with all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto. But, whatever society does, it cannot change the fact that followers of Christ are to align with, and submit to, His Word. And His Word unequivocally declares that marriage is between one man and one woman. As Christians, we accept the fact that we live in a secular and ungodly nation, but we esteem the unchanging Word of God over society\u2019s modulating mores. \u201cLet God be true, and every human being a liar\u201d (Romans 3:4). Christians do not need to fight against homosexual couples being granted civil unions and the governmental benefits such unions provide. Tax breaks, inheritance rights, hospital visitation rights, etc., are not addressed in the Bible. But, when it comes to the definition of marriage, Christians should stand firm. God created marriage. No human being has the right or authority to redefine it. No matter what governments and societies sanction, homosexual unions will never truly have equality with heterosexual marriages.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 2955, "end": 2966, "text": "heterosexual"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 2901, "end": 2910, "text": "homosexual"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2770, "end": 2772, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2683, "end": 2687, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 2495, "end": 2504, "text": "homosexual"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 2442, "end": 2447, "text": "Romans"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 2398, "end": 2400, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 2393, "end": 2439, "text": "\u201cLet God be true, and every human being a liar\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2348, "end": 2358, "text": "Word of God"}]}, {"label": ["attributes_of_god"], "points": [{"start": 2337, "end": 2346, "text": "unchanging"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 2232, "end": 2236, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 2220, "end": 2222, "text": "man"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2159, "end": 2166, "text": "His Word"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 2145, "end": 2152, "text": "His Word"}]}, {"label": ["religions_cults"], "points": [{"start": 2091, "end": 2109, "text": "followers of Christ"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 1908, "end": 1910, "text": "gay"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 1821, "end": 1823, "text": "gay"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1670, "end": 1672, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 1600, "end": 1609, "text": "homosexual"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 1405, "end": 1414, "text": "homosexual"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1382, "end": 1391, "text": "Biblically"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1362, "end": 1370, "text": "Ephesians"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1340, "end": 1352, "text": "1 Corinthians"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1326, "end": 1332, "text": "Genesis"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 1304, "end": 1308, "text": "woman"}]}, {"label": ["sex_gender"], "points": [{"start": 1294, "end": 1296, "text": "man"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1251, "end": 1253, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1230, "end": 1232, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1203, "end": 1207, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1179, "end": 1191, "text": "1 Corinthians"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1163, "end": 1168, "text": "Romans"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1146, "end": 1154, "text": "Leviticus"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 1111, "end": 1123, "text": "homosexuality"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1080, "end": 1084, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 1029, "end": 1038, "text": "Biblically"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 822, "end": 824, "text": "gay"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 753, "end": 755, "text": "gay"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 565, "end": 567, "text": "gay"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 293, "end": 302, "text": "homosexual"}]}, {"label": ["sexual_orientation"], "points": [{"start": 68, "end": 70, "text": "gay"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541293268000, "last_updated_at": 1541293268000, "sec_taken": 690, "last_updated_by": "yajT2EOX1bUmgVyczHYADROwamF3", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "n\nThe scene in Revelation 5 is John\u2019s vision of heaven\u2019s throne room. When the Lamb had taken the scroll of God\u2019s judgment into His own hand, \u201cthe four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God\u2019s people\u201d (verse 8). Revelation is the most symbolic book in the Bible, and in this passage the \u201cprayers of the saints\u201d are symbolized as golden bowls of incense, held by twenty-four elders. Of course, the more symbolic something is, the more its interpretations can vary, but it\u2019s important to understand what these prayers of the saints are\u2014and what they are not. God established incense as a part of the sacerdotal system (and therefore as symbolism) in Exodus 30:1\u201310 when Moses was told to build the altar of incense. The prayers of the saints in Revelation 5:8, especially as represented by incense in the context of temple imagery, should be understood to take the role of incense in the temple, which was to offer up a sweet aroma to God and to symbolize prayer. The prayers of the righteous are pleasing to Him. Psalm 141:2 describes this aspect of prayer perfectly: \u201cMay my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice\u201d (Psalm 141:2). Prayer is linked to the incense in the temple in other passages, as well. When Gabriel appears to Zechariah in the temple and tells him that his prayers have been answered, Gabriel is \u201cstanding at the right side of the altar of incense\u201d (Luke 1:11). This happened when \u201cthe whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense\u201d (verse 10). There are certainly different types of prayers. Prayers of supplication are the type most people are familiar with, because that\u2019s the type where we ask God for help! But there are other types, too, like the prayers of imprecation (Psalm 55:1:15) and prayers of intercession (Luke 23:34). The fact that the \u201cprayers of the saints\u201d in Revelation 5:8 are not identified by type or in detail\u2014and that they are together in an incense bowl\u2014indicates that we should consider them collectively. God considers prayer-at-large as incense\u2014a sweet aroma to Him. The fact that these are prayers \u201cof the saints\u201d in Revelation 5:8 indicates that God hears the prayers of His people. Psalm 65:2 addresses God as \u201cYou who answer prayer.\u201d Our Lord \u201chears the prayer of the righteous\u201d (Proverbs 15:29), which is another way of saying that He listens to the prayers of the saints. The \u201csaints\u201d in Revelation 5:8 are not an elite class of people who are more holy than the rest; they are not mediators of our prayers (see 1 Timothy 2:5), and they do not ask us to pray to them. The term saint in Scripture implies parity, not hierarchy. We are all one in Christ (Galatians 3:28). The saints are all believers in Jesus, living or dead, saved by grace through faith. The church is \u201cloved by God and called to be saints\u201d (Romans 1:7, ESV), and, when we pray, it\u2019s as if a golden bowl of incense is being carried to the very throne of God in heaven. Whom are these prayers of the saints for in Revelation 5:8? Since these prayers are the aggregate of all believers\u2019 prayers through all time, they are about everybody and about everything that is consistent with God\u2019s will. If you pray for somebody\u2019s salvation, that prayer is in the bowl. If you pray for the safety and relief of people after a natural disaster, that prayer is in the bowl. If you pray that God would conform you into the image of Jesus Christ, that prayer is in the bowl. Such prayers are well-pleasing to Him. Does Revelation 5:8 lend credence to the tradition of praying for the dead? Not at all. The dead have already sealed their fate, for good or for evil (see Luke 16:19\u201331). There is no post-mortem plan of salvation. Now is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2). After death, a person faces judgment, not further opportunity (Hebrews 9:27). So, if you pray that God would save or relieve someone who has already died, that prayer would not be in the bowl. Such prayers are futile. In Revelation 5, God\u2019s plan is near to being accomplished. The judgment of the wicked world is about to commence, and the ultimate redemption of God\u2019s people is about to be realized. The living creatures and elders sing a hymn of praise to the Lamb: \u201cWith your blood you purchased for God / persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. / You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, / and they will reign on the earth\u201d (Revelation 5:9&ndash10). The golden vessels full of incense are proffered to God, whose word will stand, whose will is accomplished, and who will pronounce the final \u201cAmen!\u201d to the prayers of the saints.",

{"content": "\nFirst Corinthians 13 offers one of the Bible\u2019s richest expositions regarding love. Verse 4 notes that love \u201cdoes not envy.\u201d So, selfish jealousy is at odds with God\u2019s type of love. The Greek word translated \u201cenvy\u201d means \u201cto burn with zeal.\u201d Literally, the sense is \u201cto be heated or to boil over with envy, hatred, or anger.\u201d In the context of 1 Corinthians 13, the idea is that love does not focus on personal desires. It is not eager to increase possessions. God\u2019s type of love is selfless, not selfish. Envy is the opposite of God\u2019s command not to covet (Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21). \u201cLove is the fulfillment of the law\u201d (Romans 13:10). The one who truly loves will be in conformity to the Ten Commandments, and envy will be excluded. In contrast to God\u2019s command, the Corinthian believers were ranking some spiritual gifts as more important than others and envying those who had the \u201cbest\u201d gifts. In chapter 12, Paul points out that the different gifts are meant to serve one another and build up the church. No one person has all the gifts, but each child of God has at least one, and love demands that each gift be used to serve others rather than self.\u201cEnvy rots the bones\u201d (Proverbs 14:30). When we crave what someone else has rather than being grateful for what God has given, we hurt ourselves. Instead of envying others, we are called to love them. True love\u2014God\u2019s love\u2014rejoices when others are blessed. There is no room for envy. Love does not seek to benefit itself and it is content with what it has, because its focus is on meeting the needs of the loved one.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["attributes_of_god"], "points": [{"start": 1373, "end": 1382, "text": "God\u2019s love"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1373, "end": 1375, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1274, "end": 1276, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 1185, "end": 1192, "text": "Proverbs"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 1162, "end": 1182, "text": "\u201cEnvy rots the bones\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 1067, "end": 1069, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 919, "end": 922, "text": "Paul"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 756, "end": 758, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["religious_customs_restrictions"], "points": [{"start": 696, "end": 711, "text": "Ten Commandments"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 628, "end": 633, "text": "Romans"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 590, "end": 625, "text": "\u201cLove is the fulfillment of the law\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 571, "end": 581, "text": "Deuteronomy"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 557, "end": 562, "text": "Exodus"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 529, "end": 531, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 460, "end": 462, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 343, "end": 355, "text": "1 Corinthians"}]}, {"label": ["god_the_father"], "points": [{"start": 161, "end": 163, "text": "God"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 102, "end": 122, "text": "love \u201cdoes not envy.\u201d"}]}, {"label": ["holy_books"], "points": [{"start": 39, "end": 43, "text": "Bible"}]}, {"label": ["books_of_the_bible"], "points": [{"start": 0, "end": 16, "text": "First Corinthians"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541278670000, "last_updated_at": 1541278670000, "sec_taken": 473, "last_updated_by": "yajT2EOX1bUmgVyczHYADROwamF3", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}

{"content": "\nJesus said, \u201cAsk and you will receive, and your joy will be complete\u201d in John 16:24. Similar statements are found in Matthew 7:7; 21:22; Mark 11:24; Luke 11:9; and John 15:7. Is this a blanket promise with no conditions? If we ask for three hundred pounds of chocolate delivered to our door, is God obligated to give it to us? Or are Jesus\u2019 words to be understood in light of other revelation? If we assume that \u201cask and you will receive\u201d means \u201cask for anything you want and I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d then we have turned the Lord into a cosmic genie who serves our every whim. This is the problem of prosperity gospel and word of faith teachings. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says that whoever asks receives, whoever seeks finds, and whoever knocks will find an open door (Matthew 7:7\u20138). But with this and all other verses we must examine the context. Jesus goes on to say that God will not fail to give His children good things (verse 11). So, this is one condition to the promise of \u201cask and receive\u201d: what we ask for must be good in God\u2019s estimation. God will give advantageous gifts to His children; He will not give us bad or injurious things, no matter how much we clamor for them. The best example of a good gift is the Holy Spirit, according to Luke 11:13. We begin to see a two-fold purpose of prayer\u2014to increase our understanding of what God calls \u201cgood\u201d and to cultivate a desire in us for what is good. Our prayers to God are not unlike our requests of men. Our prayers are based in a relationship, as Jesus points out in Matthew 7:8. If a child asks his father for something the father knows to be hurtful, the request is denied. The child may be frustrated and unhappy when he doesn\u2019t get what he asked for, but he should trust his father. Conversely, when the child asks for something that the father knows is beneficial, the father will provide it eagerly because he loves his child. We have another condition to the promise of \u201cask and receive\u201d in John 14:14, \u201cYou may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\u201d Here, Jesus does not promise His disciples anything and everything they want; rather, He instructs them to ask \u201cin my name.\u201d To pray in Jesus\u2019 name is to pray on the basis of Jesus\u2019 authority, but it also involves praying according to the will of God, for the will of God is what Jesus always did (John 6:38). This truth is stated explicitly in 1 John 5:14, \u201cIf we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.\u201d Our requests must be congruent with the will of God. The promise of \u201cask and receive,\u201d even with its conditions, can never disappoint. There is no chance of things we need not being in God\u2019s will. He promises to supply what we need when we \u201cseek first his kingdom and his righteousness\u201d (Matthew 6:33). Of course, what we want is not always what we need. If what we want is not in God\u2019s will, then we really don\u2019t want to receive it. God knows what is good for us and is faithful and loving to say \u201cno\u201d to selfish and foolish prayers, no matter how much we want what we\u2019re asking for. God will always give us good things. Our job is to understand what is good, so that we know what to ask for. The natural mind cannot understand this. But, when we offer ourselves as \u201ca living sacrifice\u201d and are transformed by the renewing of our minds, then we \u201cwill be able to test and approve what God\u2019s will is\u2014his good, pleasing and perfect will\u201d (Romans 12:1\u20132). Then, asking for what we need in faith, we will have all we need for life and godliness and fullness of joy (John 16:24). The biblical instruction concerning prayer is that we pray for the good things that we truly need, according to the will of God, in the authority of Jesus Christ, persistently (see Luke 18:1), unselfishly (see James 4:3), and in faith (see James 1:6). In Matthew 21:22 Jesus again emphasizes faith: \u201cIf you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\u201d Those who truly believe God will witness the amazing, infinite power of God. However, comparing Scripture with Scripture, we know that the asking must be done within the will of God. Part of having faith is acceding to God\u2019s plan as best. If we ask for healing, and that is the best thing for us, we should not doubt that God will heal us. If He does not heal, then not being healed is a necessary part of a larger plan\u2014one that is ultimately for our good. Consider Psalm 37:4: \u201cDelight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.\u201d This verse does not give us a way to manipulate God; nor does it mean that, if we obey, He will reward us with whatever treat we crave. Rather, it means that, when we delight ourselves in God, then we will find everything we want and need in Him. The key here is that the heart of the seeker is changed\u2014when we delight in the Lord, God\u2019s desires begin to become our own. When our desires match God\u2019s, then our prayers are automatically aligned with His will. Among the most important prayers in the life of a Christian are \u201cTeach me to love you above all else\u201d and \u201cCause me to want what you want.\u201d When we truly desire God, when we are passionate to see His will accomplished in this world, and when we ask for what brings Him glory, He is eager to give us anything we ask for. Sometimes the things that glorify God are pleasant\u2014a marriage or a child. Sometimes they are difficult for us\u2014a failure that humbles us or a physical weakness that makes us more dependent upon God (see 2 Corinthians 12:7). But, when we pray within His will, in the authority of Jesus, persistently, unselfishly, and in faith, we will receive what we need.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent",

{"content": "n\nAmaziah was a king of the southern kingdom of Judah from 796 to 767 BC. He succeeded his father, King Joash, who was originally a righteous king but turned aside later in life and was assassinated by his own officials (2 Kings 12:20\u201321). One of Amaziah\u2019s first acts was to bring justice upon the murderers of his father (2 Kings 14:5). The Bible summarizes Amaziah\u2019s reign thus: \u201cHe did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done\u201d (2 Kings 14:3). One of Amaziah\u2019s failings was that, while he led the people of Judah in worshiping the Lord, he failed to remove the high places where people continued to sacrifice and burn incense in violation of God\u2019s instruction to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem (verse 4; cf. Deuteronomy 12:13\u201314). Amaziah later conquered the Edomites and foolishly brought back their gods and sacrificed to them. This idolatry resulted in an unnamed prophet coming to Amaziah and rebuking him. Amaziah insolently resisted the prophet\u2019s words, saying to him, \u201cSince when have I made you the king\u2019s counselor?\u201d (2 Chronicles 25:16, NLT). The prophet was not to be intimidated, however. He told King Amaziah, \u201cI know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel\u201d (verse 16). Amaziah\u2019s defeat of the Edomites had made him overconfident, so he sent a challenge to King Jehoash of Israel to meet him in battle (2 Kings 14:8; 2 Chronicles 25:17). Jehoash recognized Amaziah\u2019s arrogance and refused the challenge, knowing that he could easily defeat the smaller territory of Judah (2 Kings 14:9\u201310; 2 Chronicles 25:18\u201319). But Amaziah would not back down, and so Jehoash attacked, defeating the army of Judah and capturing Amaziah. Amaziah was taken to Jerusalem where Jehoash plundered the temple before returning to Samaria (2 Kings 14:14; 2 Chronicles 25:24). After Jehoash died, Amaziah lived another 15 years. It is unknown whether he returned to rule in Jerusalem, but, in any case, the men of Judah were conspiring against him, causing him to flee to Lachish in southwestern Judah. But the assassins sent after Amaziah found him and killed him. \u201cHe was brought back by horse and was buried with his ancestors in the City of Judah\u201d (2 Chronicles 25:28). Amaziah could have had a long, successful reign had he continued following the Lord, but his story became another cautionary tale of the fate of the kings who turned aside to idolatry.", "annotation": {"classificationResult": [{"name": "Intent", "classes": ["other"]}], "annotationResult": [{"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2264, "end": 2270, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 2122, "end": 2128, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1887, "end": 1893, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1736, "end": 1742, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1727, "end": 1733, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1631, "end": 1637, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1471, "end": 1477, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1284, "end": 1290, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1151, "end": 1157, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 948, "end": 954, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 922, "end": 928, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 768, "end": 774, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 489, "end": 495, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["scripture_quote_paraphrase"], "points": [{"start": 381, "end": 463, "text": "He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 358, "end": 364, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 246, "end": 252, "text": "Amaziah"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 103, "end": 107, "text": "Joash"}]}, {"label": ["biblical_characters"], "points": [{"start": 1, "end": 7, "text": "Amaziah"}]}]}, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541274512000, "last_updated_at": 1541274512000, "sec_taken": 112, "last_updated_by": "HgM0yM1HlZNxjHRR0juGbaQsu2n2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
{"content": "\nThere is no doubt that the number of different religions in the world makes it a challenge to know which one is correct. First, let\u2019s consider some thoughts on the overall subject and then look at how one might approach the topic in a manner that can actually get to a right conclusion about God. The challenge of different answers to a particular issue is not unique to the topic of religion. For example, you can sit 100 math students down, give them a complex problem to solve, and it is likely that many will get the answer wrong. But does this mean that a correct answer does not exist? Not at all. Those who get the answer wrong simply need to be shown their error and know the techniques necessary to arrive at the correct answer.How do we arrive at the truth about God? We use a systematic methodology that is designed to separate truth from error by using various tests for truth, with the end result being a set of right conclusions. Can you imagine the end results a scientist would arrive at if he went into the lab and just started mixing things together with no rhyme or reason? Or if a physician just started treating a patient with random medicines in the hope of making him well? Neither the scientist nor the physician takes this approach; instead, they use systematic methods that are methodical, logical, evidential, and proven to yield the right end result.This being the case, why should theology\u2014the study of God\u2014be any different? Why believe it can be approached in a haphazard and undisciplined way and still yield right conclusions? Unfortunately, this is the approach many take, and this is one of the reasons why so many religions exist. That said, we now return to the question of how to reach truthful conclusions about God. What systematic approach should be used? First, we need to establish a framework for testing various truth claims, and then we need a roadmap to follow to reach a right conclusion. Here is a good framework to use:1. Logical consistency\u2014the claims of a belief system must logically cohere to each other and not contradict in any way. As an example, the end goal of Buddhism is to rid oneself of all desires. Yet, one must have a desire to rid oneself of all desires, which is a contradictory and illogical principle.2. Empirical adequacy\u2014is there evidence to support the belief system (whether the evidence is rational, externally evidential, etc.)? Naturally, it is only right to want proof for important claims being made so the assertions can be verified. For example, Mormons teach that Jesus visited North America. Yet there is absolutely no proof, archaeological or otherwise, to support such a claim.3. Existential relevancy\u2014the belief system should address the big questions of life described below and the teachings should be accurately reflected in the world in which we live. Christianity, for example, provides good answers for the large questions of life, but is sometimes questioned because of its claim of an all-good and powerful God who exists alongside a world filled with very real evil. Critics charge that such a thing violates the criteria of existential relevancy, although many good answers have been given to address the issue.The above framework, when applied to the topic of religion, will help lead one to a right view of God and will answer the four big questions of life:1. Origin \u2013 where did we come from?2. Ethics \u2013 how should we live?3. Meaning \u2013 what is the purpose for life?4. Destiny \u2013 where is mankind heading? But how does one go about applying this framework in the pursuit of God? A step-by-step question/answer approach is one of the best tactics to employ. Narrowing the list of possible questions down produces the following:1. Does absolute truth exist?2. Do reason and religion mix?3. Does God exist?4. Can God be known?5. Is Jesus God?6. Does God care about me?First we need to know if absolute truth exists. If it does not, then we really cannot be sure of anything (spiritual or not), and we end up either an agnostic, unsure if we can really know anything, or a pluralist, accepting every position because we are not sure which, if any, is right.Absolute truth is defined as that which matches reality, that which corresponds to its object, telling it like it is. Some say there is no such thing as absolute truth, but taking such a position becomes self-defeating. For example, the relativist says, \u201cAll truth is relative,\u201d yet one must ask: is that statement absolutely true? If so, then absolute truth exists; if not, then why consider it? Postmodernism affirms no truth, yet it affirms at least one absolute truth: postmodernism is true. In the end, absolute truth becomes undeniable.Further, absolute truth is naturally narrow and excludes its opposite. Two plus two equals four, with no other answer being possible. This point becomes critical as different belief systems and worldviews are compared. If one belief system has components that are proven true, then any competing belief system with contrary claims must be false. Also, we must keep in mind that absolute truth is not impacted by sincerity and desire. No matter how sincerely someone embraces a lie, it is still a lie. And no desire in the world can make something true that is false.The answer of question one is that absolute truth exists. This being the case, agnosticism, postmodernism, relativism, and skepticism are all false positions.This leads us to the next question of whether reason/logic can be used in matters of religion. Some say this is not possible, but\u2014why not? The truth is, logic is vital when examining spiritual claims because it helps us understand why some claims should be excluded and others embraced. Logic is absolutely critical in dismantling pluralism (which says that all truth claims, even those that oppose each other, are equal and valid).For example, Islam and Judaism claim that Jesus is not God, whereas Christianity claims He is. One of the core laws of logic is the law of non-contradiction, which says something cannot be both \u201cA\u201d and \u201cnon-A\u201d at the same time and in the same sense. Applying this law to the claims of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity means that one is right and the other two are wrong. Jesus cannot be both God and not God. Used properly, logic is a potent weapon against pluralism because it clearly demonstrates that contrary truth claims cannot both be true. This understanding topples the whole \u201ctrue for you but not for me\u201d mindset.Logic also dispels the whole \u201call roads lead to the top of the mountain\u201d analogy that pluralists use. Logic shows that each belief system has its own set of signs that point to radically different locations in the end. Logic shows that the proper illustration of a search for spiritual truth is more like a maze\u2014one path makes it through to truth, while all others arrive at dead ends. All faiths may have some surface similarities, but they differ in major ways in their core doctrines.The conclusion is that you can use reason and logic in matters of religion. That being the case, pluralism (the belief that all truth claims are equally true and valid) is ruled out because it is illogical and contradictory to believe that diametrically opposing truth claims can both be right.Next comes the big question: does God exist? Atheists and naturalists (who do not accept anything beyond this physical world and universe) say \u201cno.\u201d While volumes have been written and debates have raged throughout history on this question, it is actually not difficult to answer. To give it proper attention, you must first ask this question: Why do we have something rather than nothing at all? In other words, how did you and everything around you get here? The argument for God can be presented very simply:Something exists.You do not get something from nothing.Therefore, a necessary and eternal Being exists.You cannot deny you exist because you have to exist in order to deny your own existence (which is self-defeating), so the first premise above is true. No one has ever demonstrated that something can come from nothing unless they redefine what \u2018nothing\u2019 is, so the second premise rings true. Therefore, the conclusion naturally follows\u2014an eternal Being is responsible for everything that exists.This is a position no thinking atheist denies; they just claim that the universe is that eternal being. However, the problem with that stance is that all scientific evidence points to the fact that the universe had a beginning (the \u2018big bang\u2019). And everything that has a beginning must have a cause; therefore, the universe had a cause and is not eternal. Because the only two sources of eternality are an eternal universe (denied by all current empirical evidence) or an eternal Creator, the only logical conclusion is that God exists. Answering the question of God\u2019s existence in the affirmative rules out atheism as a valid belief system.Now, this conclusion says nothing about what kind of God exists, but amazingly enough, it does do one sweeping thing\u2014it rules out all pantheistic religions. All pantheistic worldviews say that the universe is God and is eternal. And this assertion is false. So, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and all other pantheistic religions are ruled out as valid belief systems.Further, we learn some interesting things about this God who created the universe. He is:\u2022 Supernatural in nature (as He exists outside of His creation)\u2022 Incredibly powerful (to have created all that is known)\u2022 Eternal (self-existent, as He exists outside of time and space)\u2022 Omnipresent (He created space and is not limited by it)\u2022 Timeless and changeless (He created time)\u2022 Immaterial (because He transcends space)\u2022 Personal (the impersonal can\u2019t create personality)\u2022 Necessary (as everything else depends on Him)\u2022 Infinite and singular (as you cannot have two infinites)\u2022 Diverse yet has unity (as all multiplicity implies a prior singularity)\u2022 Intelligent (supremely, to create everything)\u2022 Purposeful (as He deliberately created everything)\u2022 Moral (no moral law can exist without a lawgiver)\u2022 Caring (or no moral laws would have been given)This Being exhibits characteristics very similar to the God of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, which interestingly enough, are the only core faiths left standing after atheism and pantheism have been eliminated. Note also that one of the big questions in life (origins) is now answered: we know where we came from.This leads to the next question: can we know God? At this point, the need for religion is replaced by something more important\u2014the need for revelation. If mankind is to know this God well, it is up to God to reveal Himself to His creation. Judaism, Islam, and Christianity all claim to have a book that is God\u2019s revelation to man, but the question is which (if any) is actually true? Pushing aside minor differences, the two core areas of dispute are 1) the New Testament of the Bible 2) the person of Jesus Christ. Islam and Judaism both claim the New Testament of the Bible is untrue in what it claims, and both deny that Jesus is God incarnate, while Christianity affirms both to be true.There is no faith on the planet that can match the mountains of evidence that exist for Christianity. From the voluminous number of ancient manuscripts, to the very early dating of the documents written during the lifetime of the eyewitnesses (some only 15 years after Christ\u2019s death), to the multiplicity of the accounts (nine authors in 27 books of the New Testament), to the archaeological evidence\u2014none of which has ever contradicted a single claim the New Testament makes\u2014to the fact that the apostles went to their deaths claiming they had seen Jesus in action and that He had come back from the dead, Christianity sets the bar in terms of providing the proof to back up its claims. The New Testament\u2019s historical authenticity\u2014that it conveys a truthful account of the actual events as they occurred\u2014is the only right conclusion to reach once all the evidence has been examined.When it comes to Jesus, one finds a very curious thing about Him\u2014He claimed to be God in the flesh. Jesus\u2019 own words (e.g., \u201cBefore Abraham was born I AM\u201d), His actions (e.g., forgiving sins, accepting worship), His sinless and miraculous life (which He used to prove His truth claims over opposing claims), and His resurrection all support His claims to be God. The New Testament writers affirm this fact over and over again in their writings.Now, if Jesus is God, then what He says must be true. And if Jesus said that the Bible is inerrant and true in everything it says (which He did), this must mean that the Bible is true in what it proclaims. As we have already learned, two competing truth claims cannot both be right. So anything in the Islamic Koran or writings of Judaism that contradict the Bible cannot be true. In fact, both Islam and Judaism fail since they both say that Jesus is not God incarnate, while the evidence says otherwise. And because we can indeed know God (because He has revealed Himself in His written Word and in Christ), all forms of agnosticism are refuted. Lastly, another big question of life is answered\u2014that of ethics\u2014as the Bible contains clear instructions on how mankind ought to live.This same Bible proclaims that God cares deeply for mankind and wishes all to know Him intimately. In fact, He cares so much that He became a man to show His creation exactly what He is like. There are many men who have sought to be God, but only one God who sought to be man so He could save those He deeply loves from an eternity separated from Him. This fact demonstrates the existential relevancy of Christianity and also answers that last two big questions of life\u2014meaning and destiny. Each person has been designed by God for a purpose, and each has a destiny that awaits him\u2014one of eternal life with God or eternal separation from Him. This deduction (and the point of God becoming a man in Christ) also refutes Deism, which says God is not interested in the affairs of mankind.In the end, we see that ultimate truth about God can be found and the worldview maze successfully navigated by testing various truth claims and systematically pushing aside falsehoods so that only the truth remains. Using the tests of logical consistency, empirical adequacy, and existential relevancy, coupled with asking the right questions, yields truthful and reasonable conclusions about religion and God. Everyone should agree that the only reason to believe something is that it is true\u2014nothing more. Sadly, true belief is a matter of the will, and no matter how much logical evidence is presented, some will still choose to deny the God who is there and miss the one true path to harmony with Him.",

{"content": "\nTwo passages in the New Testament are typically used to discuss what is sometimes called \u201cthe gift of celibacy.\u201d The first is Matthew 19:9-12, \"'I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.' The disciples said to him, 'If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.\u2019 Jesus replied, 'Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.'\"The phrase \u201conly those to whom it has been given\u201d refers to people receiving what some call \u201cthe gift of celibacy\u201d or \u201cthe gift of singleness.\u201d Regardless of what we call the gift, Jesus teaches that most people do not naturally desire to remain single and celibate for a lifetime. The exceptions are those who have \u201crenounced marriage\u201d for the kingdom\u2019s sake. Such celibates have received a special gift from God.The other pertinent passage is 1 Corinthians 7. In this chapter Paul states that it is not wrong to get married, but that it is better if a Christian can stay single. (The reason is that a married man\u2019s attention is \u201cdivided\u201d between pleasing the Lord and pleasing his wife; a single man is free to be more focused on the Lord\u2019s work, verses 32-34.) Paul says, \u201cI wish that all men were [unmarried] as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that\u201d (verse 7). Paul is careful to state that this is \u201ca concession, not . . . a command\u201d (verse 6). The ability to stay single and serve God apart from marriage is a gift. Paul and some others had this gift, but not everyone.As we see, the Bible does not explicitly call this \u201cthe gift of celibacy,\u201d but it does express that the ability to remain unmarried to serve God more fully is a gift. Most adults desire marriage, and this desire is not sinful. In fact, marriage can keep us from sin: \u201cSince there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:2). Rather than engage in immorality, believers are to be married. Sex within marriage between one man and one woman or celibate singleness\u2014these are the only two options for Christians.Although the Bible does speak of celibacy as a gift, it is not listed with the spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12; Roman 12). Singleness is a gift that God gives everyone, at least temporarily. For some, the gift of singleness is permanent; for others, God takes that gift away and gives the gift of marriage in its place. The Bible encourages those who are celibate in Christian service that they are an important part of God\u2019s family.", "annotation": null, "extras": null, "metadata": {"first_done_at": 1541282000000, "last_updated_at": 1541282000000, "sec_taken": 0, "last_updated_by": "xDPdj3DraCaPxIDu0WPn8X4MNDX2", "status": "done", "evaluation": "NONE"}}
